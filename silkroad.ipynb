      "\t\t\t\t\tAtlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go.  Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well.  They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay #1, we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty.There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well.  Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming.  What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life.  I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another.  I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause.  I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter.  If you haven't read it yet, please do.  Here is the link:silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charterThe bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart.  I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here.Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don't have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain.  And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site.  Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tok, we're just finishing up some of these changes and starting to push the data out to the pages on the site.  Most of it is hidden at the moment, but you can see the layout on the vendor pages has changed.Here's where we are at:The rating algorithm has been changed to the following:A vendor's score, which determines their rank and factors into the weight of buyers, is found by adding up all of their sales with each sale multiplied by a factor that starts at 100% now and tapers off to 0% after 8 months.A buyer's score, which affects how heavily their feedback is weighted when determining a vendor's rating (not rank), is found by multiplying the price of their purchases by the vendor score of the vendor they purchased from, and then adding them all togetherA rating/review's score, which determines it's weight when averaging with other ratings, is found by multiplying the buyer weight of the buyer leaving the rating, the volume of the purchase, and the same dampening factor used for the vendor's score.We also have a graphic that will appear on vendor pages and when browsing listings that shows the relative weight of the ratings 1 through 5.  I've looked at many of these for different vendors and I think it is much more informative than the simple average we have now and will take the pressure off of buyers to leave only a 5 or a 1.  This is hidden at the moment.on deck:The average rating (number in parentheses after a vendor's name) is still being calculated the old way.  We need to compare the new to the old before updating and make sure there aren't any major discrepancies.  Once this is done, we'll switch to the new system and display the rating graphic.next, we'll remove the \"leave feedback\" box from the orders page and leave just the 1 - 5 rating, and add a link to the vendor pages that shows up when you've ordered from them that you can click on and leave a review.then, we'll give the option to sort reviews by most recent or by review weight and display the buyer's stats next to the review (total spent, total transaction, number of vendors bought from, and maybe buyer weight)There is one last thing on deck, but I'm going to leave it as a surprise \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tThe people who drafted and signed the declaration of independence 237 years ago today were standing up to tyrants just as we are.  I'm proud to carry on their legacy.  Here are their words, many of which ring true still today:---When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these ColoniesFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n",

      "Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amYep he's got you there!Anyway;My thoughts on slavery are that if you sell your self into slavery you are not a slave; you have merely entered into a rather onerous employment contract. You cannot include your future offspring in the deal as children are not property.Enslaving by force I would have thought is not permitted even by the most extravagant libertarian.       I have continued reading this book ( skipping over his constant crude mischaracterisations of socialism) with interest. I must admit to difficulty in understanding why the author is so idealogically committed to the market as the absolute and only judge of human endevour. To me, the market is a natural force; an extremely complex system of counterbalancing forces that has a tendency to self regulate. But to claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.     An analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.        The market was made for man. It should not be master.        Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\". But we are not talking about teenagers earning spending money here. Child labour regulations were brought in after the industrial revolution, when unbridled capitalism amongst the factories and mills of northern England had driven wages for the \"hands\" below subsistence level. The children of these working families \"wanted\" the \"freedom\" to work, as the alternative was hunger. This to me seems a poor kind of freedom.          You all seem to agree that to force a child to work against his will was wrong. But what if the economic system you have established leaves a child with this kind of choice? Where is the freedom for this child? Work or starve?        Sadly there are many children in the world today faced with this choice. But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.         I feel about the market a similar way that I feel about government: when it ceases to serve our purpose we may freely discard it in favor of a better system.         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations. In many industries there are 3-4 main  players offering roughly the same range of products for the same price, and this tends to lessen the benefits of competition for the consumer. And even when the customer benefits, the suppliers don't.       Large companies suffer many of the same faults as large governments: a tendency to seek nothing but a continuation of their own power. We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force. With all due respect, that's kind of the problem with private police forces! I have difficulty seeing how such a system could work peacefully to resolve disputes.       If I assault my neighbor, who's police force deals with the complaint? His or mine? Or do we both have the same one, being neighbors.       If I am paying a private force, do they take my side automatically. Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.       Some good points ghost, and thanks for not taking offense when the author criticizes your views.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amAn analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.This gave me pause, because I can see your point.  I think I see where your analogy breaks down though.  There are no competing interests within your self.  You are a unit, an indivisible will or being.  The choices you make to achieve your ends are yours alone.  If your body is ailing and you take medicine, the outcome is your responsibility.  Human civilization on the other hand is made up of many beings, each with their own interests.  What one perceives as good, another may perceive as bad.  Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amThe market was made for man. It should not be master.As described in section 2 of the reading, the market is not yet another policy prescription enforced by government, it is the absence of such force.  It is the absence of one party imposing their view of good and bad on another.  So, the market is not made, it emerges from the multitude of voluntary interactions between individuals.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\".

But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.I'm not sure how we disagree here.  If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option?  If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse.  That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves.  Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities.Had they been allowed to develop freely, only under the constrains of supply, demand and property rights, they would have had to provide a safe work environment for their employees, if that's what the employees wanted.  Let me give you a quick example.  Nike and Reebok both have shoe factories in the same city.  All of their resources and external conditions are effectively identical.  The only thing they can vary is the quality of the work environment for their employees.  Nike chooses to spend $1 per man-hour maintaining an improved work environment for its employees, while Reebok keeps that dollar as profit.  Reebok will quickly find itself unable to attract the employee base it needs to produce its shoes as Nike takes its employees and market share.  So, Reebok, instead of improving the work conditions, simply passes the extra $1 per hour on to their employees.  Now we are seeing the market at work.  Employees are now faced with the option of a safe work environment, or an extra dollar per hour.  Some will choose safety while others will choose the extra pay.And this is exactly what has happened eventually, where now employers do all they can to attract good employees away from their competitors.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations. In many industries there are 3-4 main  players offering roughly the same range of products for the same price, and this tends to lessen the benefits of competition for the consumer. And even when the customer benefits, the suppliers don't.       Large companies suffer many of the same faults as large governments: a tendency to seek nothing but a continuation of their own power. We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.I have also noticed this tendency.  The people who run corporations, heads of state, the person selling you food, you, me and every human being are all fallible and capable of using power to dominate other people.  Liberty is not a pill that makes men angels.  What it does do is limit the extent to which evil can be expressed in the world.  Right now, in any given geographic area, we have a monopoly on many of the most vital social institutions that is maintained through violence.  If voluntary organizations consolidate their power and turn on their customers and start stealing from them, putting them in cages, killing them, spying on them and telling them what they can and can't do, well then we're back to where we started, the present day state.  But, if I am correct, and the pressure for those firms to compete with one another for our favor leads them to serve us, then we can have freedom and prosperity the likes of which the world has never known.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force. With all due respect, that's kind of the problem with private police forces! I have difficulty seeing how such a system could work peacefully to resolve disputes.       If I assault my neighbor, who's police force deals with the complaint? His or mine? Or do we both have the same one, being neighbors.       If I am paying a private force, do they take my side automatically. Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.Maybe we can read this essay next, but check out Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy.  He speculates how a free market in security services might organize itself, but his most important point is that no one knows ahead of time how an industry will organize.  The security industry has been insulated from market conditions for so long and is so out of touch with the needs of its customers, that I suspect it would be unrecognizable after a transition to its optimal form.  There are ten thousand questions that we could muse about similar to the one you posed, but the point is that, if we do our best to adhere to the non-aggression principle, then we can quickly move in the right direction without having to know ahead of time exactly how the final form of such an institution would look.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.This is where the institution of private property and markets really shine.  Markets curb unsustainable growth through the price mechanism.  As a needed resource is depleted, its supply drops and, assuming constant or rising demand, its price will rise.  Rising prices force people to consume LESS of the resource and save more of it.  Private property also incentivizes people to maximize the value of it.  People tend to preserve and improve their land and capital.  Free enterprise and private property, when honored, are an environmentalists dream.  These institutions maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used to satisfy people's desires, and have natural rationing mechanisms built in to keep people from over consuming.  If we ever get into some economic theory in this club, we can talk about the concept of the evenly rotating economy, which really drives the point home how only a free society can ever have a hope at sustainability.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amto claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.I can assure you that I am not willfully ignorant.  I have a very open mind and if an argument that can stand up to reason and be shown to accurately describe reality is presented to me, then I would gladly change my mind. My views have been forged by a search for the truth that has lasted my entire adult life and continues to this day.  I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors.  Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward.  Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs?  We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tThank you for expressing a dissenting viewpoint.  I appreciate a civilized debate, so allow me to respond.  Quote from: bitfool on September 23, 2012, 07:15 amSilk road is nice because it's a fuck-you of sorts to the powers that be......but...It will have no impact whatsoever on the so called war on drugs. It's not going to affect government in any meaningful way. Agorism is a pretty lame strategy.  It may even backfire (from the point of view of agorists) and cause the government to ban tor or bitcoin or both. Of course it can be done, just ask ISPs to do a bit of traffic shaping. Lastly, DPR is doing this for the money.Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs.  The effect of the war is to limit people's access to controlled substances.  Silk Road has expanded people's access.  The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles.  Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction.  So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no?  Personally, I don't think they can be effectively banned at this point.  Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing.On your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification.  Money is one motivating factor for me.  If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor.  Money motivates me for two reasons.  For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause.  I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant.  In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally.  I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit.  Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see.  Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here.All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference.  As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people.  It's fulfilling to me.  If you don't know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you.  There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself.  It's paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on other's, the happier you'll be.  Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish \n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tTo be honest, I am quite surprised by how negative the responses have been to the State of the Road Address and how little faith you put in me after I feel like I have done so much to deserve it.  I chose the words I wrote in the Address very carefully.  I reviewed it many times.  Every one of them is true, and my sentiment is valid.  Go through and re-read it along with the clarifications.  Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me.  This change IS about scam prevention.  We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams.  We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization.  Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along.We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff.  It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change.  There is lots about this organization that just isn't going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately.  Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else's expense, or the expense of our stated goals.  If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom.  I am greedy for power.  Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs.  If we can get to that world, I can die happy.Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started.  It could literally change the world as we know it.  It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there.  Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world?  Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed?  Why aren't you telling me to raise the commission even further then?  I don't hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods.  I don't hear anyone saying “don't do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we're happy to do our part.”As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision.  Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success.  In that world, Silk Road will be a  shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy.  Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this.  We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever.I don't like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time.  Silk Road NEEDS our support.  It needs everything we have.  The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage.  HELP ME GET US THERE!!!  Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.P.S.Here's another thing that doesn't get said enough:  I love you.  This is the most fun I've ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life.  Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs.  Stand by me as we stand up for ourselves.- Silk Road admin\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\t-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1- From it's humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters.  From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome.  Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us.It didn't take long before word got out.  Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement.  But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.  It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.  We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.  A revolution has been born.  So ideally, more participants means more prosperity.  What we've found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.So, we've had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.  One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war.  This is always and ever a top priority.  The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point.  The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few).  And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.This success has in no way made us complacent however.  New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and “finalizing early”, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice.  Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved.First we must deal with trading out of escrow.  Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.  This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system.  Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it.We've worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow.  For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates:eBay     - $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.  The average response looked like this:15% of the first $1011% of $10 - $508.14% of $50 - $2505.6% of $250 - $10003.7% of $1000 - $5000We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:10% of the first $508.5% of $50 - 1506% of $150 - 3003% of $300 - 5002% of $500 - 10001.5% for everything over $1000With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.  Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.  We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.  If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)iQEbBAEBAgAGBQJPCl0BAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olWDsH9jGBcHVl302TYnOpD/oc2G9wZN1H56v/oRww3het2ESSUokjfoU3JFs5442eNvvNQohHlN3Z2gVBpm4c7BQKVBTBIlfjalIMr1bzMtjVzvwV+CJSF7KHrz91eUDICtpOgNIVQ36CxYA1c9cjHuOVVNbU6N6qVycC4TS2Oy38DUJlYm5UsLcxTqQhlLkiXuUH3uOMp7pwLfPlDmrz4nojWooqFwQ6JBFuMG5/wO0NcKgP4hXWcAmo24oGbaC6/5jUjQ7ze7ILsZf7ykeOi3O3ZhyGn2WyY5+99dc39kviJhIwQfvu8VWaDlYBgvh3PlDENIYD4ThgAzdUoW0Nha4LXA===wI/M-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----CLARIFICATION:  The new policy regarding out of escrow transactions stated in this address does not affect a vendor's ability to ask their customers to finalize their orders and release payment before shipment.  We still strongly recommend that buyers avoid doing this at all costs because we will be unable to protect you in case of fraud.CLARIFICATION:  This new policy also does not affect vendors who use the market as a platform for Bitcoin exchange.  They may continue to operate as usual, but again we strongly recommend that you purchase bitcoins through a non-anonymous vendor because the market is not set up to facilitate bitcoin exchange and your money can be stolen without recourse.FURTHER COMMENTARY: https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=8539.0\n",

Are you able to work full-time (40+ hrs/week), part-time (at least 20 hrs/week), or both? How much would you need to be paid? Were you referred by someone? Who? How did you hear about Silk Road? What is your drug of choice, if any? Anything else we should consider? We are offering a $1000 to anyone who refers the person we hire   \n",
      "Access is not necessary. At least at first, this person will be more of a dedicated expert adviser. There are many layers to this site and more we want to add, and unfortunately my expertise and time are maxed out. Several members have been very generous in volunteering their time to help improve the site, but by their nature, volunteers can only do so much and have other obligations. Right now we need someone with plenty expertise who can dedicate their time to this project and help take it to the next level. If all goes well, we'll be opening up other positions too. \n",
      "I was just alerted to this thread by Anarcho47 and have read every word, except the parts that were removed by their authors. I don't spend a whole lot of time on the forums, because I am almost always alerted to important threads on the main site. Every message that comes in from the contact us link gets read and 90% get replied to, so please feel free to contact me with any concerns you have. There were a couple of specific questions I'll address first. Passwords are hashed twice using sha256, once with a global salt and again with a user specific salt. Also, our servers are fully up to date and updates are checked for daily. How we handle addresses is explained in the buyer's guide. Your concerns are completely valid. It is absolutely terrible that there was an injection vulnerability in the search bar, and an XSS vuln in the subject line of the messages. Thankfully they were discovered by someone benevolent and we could take action to remedy them. There are no known holes in the site at the moment, but that doesn't mean they aren't there. I accept my limitations and the discovery of these holes was further confirmation that for Silk Road to grow and thrive, people with far more expertise need to be brought in. There's another thread about hiring, but long story short, we now have two brilliant IT professionals with more than 25 years of combined development and administration experience who I trust and who are committed to making our site as secure as possible. Development of a new and much improved back-end is underway, and an audit of the current code will begin this coming week with a full re-write coming thereafter. I just want to reassure you that I am doing everything I can to fulfill on your expectations of me and the site and I apologize for where I have come up short. Thank you for the trust you have put in me. I will not stop fighting this fight.   \n",
      "I haven't read every word of this thread, but hopefully my follow up messages and explanations were posted as well. Please also see my reply to the thread about security vulnerabilities because I think that was brought up in this thread too. Basically all I want to say is that my intentions are true and I didn't expect so much backlash from proposing an experiment. I made it very clear that if any negative consequences were to arise we would roll it back immediately. Contrary to popular belief I am not a millionaire and just 4 months ago, our revenue was less than $3k/month! Before that, I worked for more than a year on this project and made next to nothing, not knowing if it would even work and taking substantial personal risk. Only now are we able to start expanding as an enterprise and increased revenue would make that much easier. Everyone working for Silk Road does so at below market wages for their level of talent and we make zero profit. We are in our infant stages of growth and the faster we can mature, the better chance we have of withstanding the onslaught that WILL eventually come. We've drawn a line in the sand and are staring down our enemies. Like it or not, if you are participating here, you are standing on that line with us. This is not about making money. This is about winning a war. Look how far we've come in 8 short months. We are JUST getting started.   \n",
      "- From it's humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters. From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome. Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us. It didn't take long before word got out. Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement. But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive. It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny. We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market. A revolution has been born. So ideally, more participants means more prosperity. What we've found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it. So, we've had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves. One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war. This is always and ever a top priority. The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner. I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point. The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few). And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found. This success has in no way made us complacent however. New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and finalizing early, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice. Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved. First we must deal with trading out of escrow. Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades. This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system. Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it. We've worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow. For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates: eBay  - $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+ amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items) We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like. The average response looked like this: 15% of the first $10 11% of $10 - $50 8.14% of $50 - $250 5.6% of $250 - $1000 3.7% of $1000 - $5000 We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further: 10% of the first $50 8.5% of $50 - 150 6% of $150 - 300 3% of $300 - 500 2% of $500 - 1000 1.5% for everything over $1000 With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment. Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the contact us link on the main site. We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders. Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind. If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!  CLARIFICATION: The new policy regarding out of escrow transactions stated in this address does not affect a vendor's ability to ask their customers to finalize their orders and release payment before shipment. We still strongly recommend that buyers avoid doing this at all costs because we will be unable to protect you in case of fraud. CLARIFICATION: This new policy also does not affect vendors who use the market as a platform for Bitcoin exchange. They may continue to operate as usual, but again we strongly recommend that you purchase bitcoins through a non-anonymous vendor because the market is not set up to facilitate bitcoin exchange and your money can be stolen without recourse. FURTHER COMMENTARY: https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=8539.0 \n",
      "To be honest, I am quite surprised by how negative the responses have been to the State of the Road Address and how little faith you put in me after I feel like I have done so much to deserve it. I chose the words I wrote in the Address very carefully. I reviewed it many times. Every one of them is true, and my sentiment is valid. Go through and re-read it along with the clarifications. Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me. This change IS about scam prevention. We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams. We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization. Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along. We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff. It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change. There is lots about this organization that just isn't going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately. Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else's expense, or the expense of our stated goals. If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom. I am greedy for power. Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs. If we can get to that world, I can die happy. Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started. It could literally change the world as we know it. It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there. Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world? Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed? Why aren't you telling me to raise the commission even further then? I don't hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods. I don't hear anyone saying don't do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we're happy to do our part. As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision. Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success. In that world, Silk Road will be a shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy. Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this. We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever. I don't like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time. Silk Road NEEDS our support. It needs everything we have. The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage. HELP ME GET US THERE!!! Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind. P.S. Here's another thing that doesn't get said enough: I love you. This is the most fun I've ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life. Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs. Stand by me as we stand up for ourselves. - Silk Road admin \n",
      "You'll have to wait for my memoirs for the juicy details, lol. I've got some stories though, I'll tell ya. One weird thing that goes through my head when Silk Road goes through a growth spurt, like after the first gawker article is that sound effect from inception, or the intense music from the new tron movie. It gives me the sensation of \"holy shit, this is EPIC!\" \n",
      "Thank you for expressing a dissenting viewpoint. I appreciate a civilized debate, so allow me to respond. Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs. The effect of the war is to limit people's access to controlled substances. Silk Road has expanded people's access. The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles. Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction. So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state. The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no? Personally, I don't think they can be effectively banned at this point. Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing. On your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification. Money is one motivating factor for me. If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor. Money motivates me for two reasons. For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause. I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant. In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally. I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit. Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons. More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see. Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here. All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference. As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people. It's fulfilling to me. If you don't know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you. There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself. It's paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on other's, the happier you'll be. Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish  \n",
      "Some good points ghost, and thanks for not taking offense when the author criticizes your views. This gave me pause, because I can see your point. I think I see where your analogy breaks down though. There are no competing interests within your self. You are a unit, an indivisible will or being. The choices you make to achieve your ends are yours alone. If your body is ailing and you take medicine, the outcome is your responsibility. Human civilization on the other hand is made up of many beings, each with their own interests. What one perceives as good, another may perceive as bad. As described in section 2 of the reading, the market is not yet another policy prescription enforced by government, it is the absence of such force. It is the absence of one party imposing their view of good and bad on another. So, the market is not made, it emerges from the multitude of voluntary interactions between individuals. I'm not sure how we disagree here. If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option? If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse. That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves. Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities. Had they been allowed to develop freely, only under the constrains of supply, demand and property rights, they would have had to provide a safe work environment for their employees, if that's what the employees wanted. Let me give you a quick example. Nike and Reebok both have shoe factories in the same city. All of their resources and external conditions are effectively identical. The only thing they can vary is the quality of the work environment for their employees. Nike chooses to spend $1 per man-hour maintaining an improved work environment for its employees, while Reebok keeps that dollar as profit. Reebok will quickly find itself unable to attract the employee base it needs to produce its shoes as Nike takes its employees and market share. So, Reebok, instead of improving the work conditions, simply passes the extra $1 per hour on to their employees. Now we are seeing the market at work. Employees are now faced with the option of a safe work environment, or an extra dollar per hour. Some will choose safety while others will choose the extra pay. And this is exactly what has happened eventually, where now employers do all they can to attract good employees away from their competitors. I have also noticed this tendency. The people who run corporations, heads of state, the person selling you food, you, me and every human being are all fallible and capable of using power to dominate other people. Liberty is not a pill that makes men angels. What it does do is limit the extent to which evil can be expressed in the world. Right now, in any given geographic area, we have a monopoly on many of the most vital social institutions that is maintained through violence. If voluntary organizations consolidate their power and turn on their customers and start stealing from them, putting them in cages, killing them, spying on them and telling them what they can and can't do, well then we're back to where we started, the present day state. But, if I am correct, and the pressure for those firms to compete with one another for our favor leads them to serve us, then we can have freedom and prosperity the likes of which the world has never known. Maybe we can read this essay next, but check out Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy. He speculates how a free market in security services might organize itself, but his most important point is that no one knows ahead of time how an industry will organize. The security industry has been insulated from market conditions for so long and is so out of touch with the needs of its customers, that I suspect it would be unrecognizable after a transition to its optimal form. There are ten thousand questions that we could muse about similar to the one you posed, but the point is that, if we do our best to adhere to the non-aggression principle, then we can quickly move in the right direction without having to know ahead of time exactly how the final form of such an institution would look. This is where the institution of private property and markets really shine. Markets curb unsustainable growth through the price mechanism. As a needed resource is depleted, its supply drops and, assuming constant or rising demand, its price will rise. Rising prices force people to consume LESS of the resource and save more of it. Private property also incentivizes people to maximize the value of it. People tend to preserve and improve their land and capital. Free enterprise and private property, when honored, are an environmentalists dream. These institutions maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used to satisfy people's desires, and have natural rationing mechanisms built in to keep people from over consuming. If we ever get into some economic theory in this club, we can talk about the concept of the evenly rotating economy, which really drives the point home how only a free society can ever have a hope at sustainability. I can assure you that I am not willfully ignorant. I have a very open mind and if an argument that can stand up to reason and be shown to accurately describe reality is presented to me, then I would gladly change my mind. My views have been forged by a search for the truth that has lasted my entire adult life and continues to this day. I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors. Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward. Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs? We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to. \n",
      "Hey gang, What a week! How do I even begin trying to summarize all of this? A couple of weeks ago, we started seeing the accessibility and speed of Silk Road start to drop, especially around peak hours. Monitoring the number of incoming connections, pageviews and registrations showed record breaking numbers, so the obvious conclusion was that we were getting an influx of new members that was overloading our current infrastructure. We immediately went to work identifying and overcoming the bottlenecks in the system. However, as each was overcome, demand for resources would fill in and run up against the next bottleneck. In the past week we've literally been through every layer of our entire system from hardware, to software, to application making it more efficient and streamlined. We did not rule out the possibility that the increased usage was due to a hacking attempt (known as denial of service, or DoS) and took this time to implement several security measures that had been in the works anyway. Then the site went completely off-line. There are a few things that I don't trust to anyone else, and that's the wallets, and rebooting the system. I was away from my computer when the site went down, and came back a couple of days later to utter chaos on the forums. I've pretty much been in communication since, but basically we did a full redeploy of the entire system including the new security and performance measures which turned out to be quite challenging in the end. We ran into a few stumbling blocks, but were able to get past them. I have to take a moment here to thank my team, both the customer support staff and the technical team. These guys were right there with me the whole time and I don't think I could've gotten through it without them, certainly not as quickly. So, now we are back. What have I learned from all of this? First off, it helped me realize just how much the site means to me and all of you. These forums were like a battleground of opinion, with everyone expressing their concern. By far the worst part of this whole thing was putting everyone through that uncertainty. I knew nothing I could say would make any difference until you had access to your funds and were able to use the site again. So mostly I just focused on getting us back up as quickly as I could without cutting any corners or taking any chances. I also learned a ton about the limitations of the technology we rely on and the direction we need to go to keep Silk Road secure and scalable. Thank you to everyone who encouraged and supported me and the team this week. Your kind words were our fuel. To anyone who doubted us, or suspected us of betrayal, again, I am so sorry to put you through that uncertainty. It is not something I want to repeat ever again and you can rest assured I'll do everything I can to prevent and limit any future down time. I know this whole market is based on the trust you put in me and I don't take that lightly. It's an honor to serve you and though you don't know who I am, and have no recourse if I were to betray you, I hope that as time goes on I will have more opportunities to demonstrate that my intentions are genuine and no amount of money could buy my integrity. Especially you old hats that have been around since the beginning, but this goes for everyone, you all are like family to me. Sure we have some crazy cousins floating around, but they just add character, right? Doesn't matter though, I love you all. Of all the people in the world, you are the ones who are here, in the early stages of this revolution. You are the ones getting this thing off the ground and driving it forward.

      "Dear Silk Road community, A combination of bad luck, bad timing and lack of preparation has led to our forums being down over the last 72 hours or so. I am terribly sorry for any trouble this has caused you. The main market is equipped with a semi-automated backup and redeploy system to minimize this kind of down-time, but I hadn't gotten around to setting the forum up in that way, and this is the consequence. The cause of the downtime was not security related, nor was it caused by a malicious party. Sometimes technology just breaks, and because of the constraints from the nature of our business, it can take time to recover if proper precautions haven't been taken, or don't work as expected. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, so hopefully we can enjoy each other's company even more now that we've had some time apart. - -DPR   \n",
      "The people who drafted and signed the declaration of independence 237 years ago today were standing up to tyrants just as we are. I'm proud to carry on their legacy. Here are their words, many of which ring true still today: --- When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.  Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. \n",

      "ok, we're just finishing up some of these changes and starting to push the data out to the pages on the site. Most of it is hidden at the moment, but you can see the layout on the vendor pages has changed. Here's where we are at: The rating algorithm has been changed to the following: A vendor's score, which determines their rank and factors into the weight of buyers, is found by adding up all of their sales with each sale multiplied by a factor that starts at 100% now and tapers off to 0% after 8 months. A buyer's score, which affects how heavily their feedback is weighted when determining a vendor's rating (not rank), is found by multiplying the price of their purchases by the vendor score of the vendor they purchased from, and then adding them all together A rating/review's score, which determines it's weight when averaging with other ratings, is found by multiplying the buyer weight of the buyer leaving the rating, the volume of the purchase, and the same dampening factor used for the vendor's score. We also have a graphic that will appear on vendor pages and when browsing listings that shows the relative weight of the ratings 1 through 5. I've looked at many of these for different vendors and I think it is much more informative than the simple average we have now and will take the pressure off of buyers to leave only a 5 or a 1. This is hidden at the moment. on deck: The average rating (number in parentheses after a vendor's name) is still being calculated the old way. We need to compare the new to the old before updating and make sure there aren't any major discrepancies. Once this is done, we'll switch to the new system and display the rating graphic. next, we'll remove the \"leave feedback\" box from the orders page and leave just the 1 - 5 rating, and add a link to the vendor pages that shows up when you've ordered from them that you can click on and leave a review. then, we'll give the option to sort reviews by most recent or by review weight and display the buyer's stats next to the review (total spent, total transaction, number of vendors bought from, and maybe buyer weight) There is one last thing on deck, but I'm going to leave it as a surprise  \n",
      "Atlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go. Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well. They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay #1, we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty. There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well. Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming. What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life. I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another. I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause. I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter. If you haven't read it yet, please do. Here is the link: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charter The bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart. I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here. Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don't have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain. And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site.

      "\t\t\t\tRequiring an email address to register in the forum wasted about 2 hours of my time. I couldn't create a new Yahoo! mail account because my Tor browser doesn't have flash. gmail also would not generate an account for me. I tried 4 other free web mail hosts and I couldn't create an account on any of them either (due to the Tor browser environment limitations). For example, the CAPTCHA wouldn't display. Also, client/server javascript communication would time out (i.e. registration scripts that send each keystroke upstream run slow on Tor circuits).All in all it was a giant cluster fuck and I wish that the password database was simply replicated from Silk Road instead of requiring a new registration.Requiring an email address is a vulnerability. I wonder how many people are going to use their existing email, not realizing that it will strip their anonymity if they have accessed that email from an unshielded IP.Requiring users first to see the archived forum before bringing them to the new forum is silly.

      "\t\t\t\t@JackDanThe unfortunate truth of the matter is that the \"brick and mortar\" risk (artificial consequences imposed by moral legalists) lies entirely on the buyer.  Unless you are flashing a driver's license when sending off your product, there is nothing to tie a seller to the outgoing package (other than city of origin, in which case you could make a bi-weekly trip to the nearest larger urban post office).  The buyer assumes all of this risk, the risk to the seller is purely a financial one.This is the reason prices are a bit higher than on the street.  The seller needs to cover shipping costs, packaging costs, and the off-chance that there are a few scam buyers on SR.  That being said, I have 8 transactions so far and no one has tried to scam me yet (although 7 are still in transit thanks to the CP strike).\n",

Anyone who was actually determined to kill would not be dissuaded from that just because they get charged to do it. Law enforcement would also have no problem paying for an account.

      "\t\t\t\t1. Read wikipedia. In short, it uses math to scramble your communications, primarily GPG relies on the difficulty of factoring huge numbers into primes but the ease of multiplying two primes into a huge number. It makes it so even if your communications are intercepted, they can not be decrypted into intelligible language and rather aim to be indistinguishable from randomness. 2. So buyers can encrypt their addresses and not have them intercepted if the server is ever seized or SR is compromised3. Buyers and sellers both need to use GPG if one of them wants to, however GPG in the context of SR is almost entirely for the benefit of the buyer it does little to help the seller4. Serious risks. If SR is compromised, you are fucked, is what it comes down to. Encrypting the drive is nice but when it comes down to it this isn't going to do much by itself. Is the server in a chassis with intrusion detection / the RAM in encapsulation material? If not the attacker who manages to locate the server will merely flash freeze the RAM and dump the key. Not to mention no matter how technically secure the server is, everything on the internet can be hacked by someone if they spend enough time on it. GPG on the other hand can not be hacked by anyone, however you could be hacked and have your private key stolen just like SR's server can be hacked and have its private key stolen. But centralization is bad particularly when there is zero reason for it.  If the drive / container is encrypted + chassis intrusion detection + RAM in encapsulation material you can protect from someone with physical access getting the sensitive communications easily. And there are some other neat things you can do. For example, store everything in an encrypted container and set it to dismount immediately if anyone gains access to a shell. That might help from hackers some, but then you still need to detect the compromise prior to remounting or they will steal the key at this point. Fully server side encryption systems like this are mostly security circus imo, they can protect from some attacks but they are no replacement for GPG. And with out chassis intrusion detection + encapsulation of RAM, having it encrypted wont protect from a competent attacker with physical access. And if you don't have measures in place to dismount immediately upon a cyber intrusion being detected, it wont protect from hackers either because they will just steal the key from memory. \n",

Thus the frictions, tensions, insults and endless debates, and the total absence of a long-term project for Silk Road.\"\"There is a huge contradiction there and it doesn't make the forum a pleasant place to navigate... I'd even say that the two groups hate each other. The several big topics on Guns I've read are really full of insults, ad hominem attacks and ridiculous arguments on both sides. \"The labels and judgments you make are kind of self defeating. You say it should be totally open (it is) but then tell all the reason YOU think things should be different why YOU are disappointed. Of course there are tons of paranoid drug users here...did you expect different on an open drug vending site? Yet things run very counter to what any arrangement you see outside of SR. The users are generally bright, honest and fair people, very understanding, and willing to cooperate with each other. If this is really your 1st day, you can hardly make a judgment on that front...have you utilized SR? You seem to be advocating total openness and a non-hierarchical structure of what is sold and who should be let in; yet your comments of why some users you speak of are wrong for SR are in and of itself a hierarchical judgment. You are now saying what and who is ok, and IMO, that is what's not ok. I believe it should be truly integral. But you make a lot of good points...some natural judements have to be made. The site is open. How can SR \"bring a lot of people on board?\" They've nothing to do with who registers or not. The reason you can't open it up to the world with a www.sr.com site is pretty obvious. IP's, traceable transaction etc...In most countries, esp the USA we must contend with an adversary that has virtually unlimited resources to bother and dictate to people's personal lives. You almost have to be in a perpetual battle mode of thinking...if we became complacent or too comfortable the state WOULD take us down for a news headline. They WILL ruin your life for a political score point. That's scary...it has to be in even SR's mind as well. The site is very open IMO, literally anyone who can figure it out (the info is everywhere) can register and buy things very quickly. But being anonymous is for our own protection. The site is mostly for drugs, was started for drugs. SR would need to bring a lot of help on board I believe if they were to make it a truly anonymous marketplace were any and all wares were up for grabs. I believe the SR admin is doing most of this alone...hence the now hiring sign. This site isn't even a year old. So a lot of the things you speak of are down the pipes so to speak I believe...still working out a lot of the kinks. The varying opinions you speak of are just that. Opinions on a forum, they are bound to be vastly different...yet when you boil it all down they are in the same league and actually we are just discussing and refining a cutting-edge idea that we mostly agree on. But this is a site mostly for drug buyers I think that obvious. You may not agree with the pigeon hollers (i don't either) but to label them this or that and say they are wrong...that would be merely replicating the states own labeling of what is to be or is not to be. Another great SR quote in response to a question about addiction: “I am so sorry if someone you know has been hurt by drugs, but it is my sincere hope that by making drugs available in a safe, secure, and predictable way, that we will eliminate the violence and danger of obtaining and using drugs through traditional methods. We also hope that, by increasing competition for providing drugs in our marketplace, the quality will rise and price will drop, so that addicts can afford the drugs they need and still have money left over to live a normal life, without as much danger of overdose.\"I remember reading that it was at least somewhat inspired by the Agorist philosophy: “The state is the primary source of violence, oppression, theft and all forms of coercion,” “Stop funding the state with your tax dollars and direct your productive energies into the black market.” quote SR. Personally, like many I'd say...I do dream of a completely open market. A TRULY free market would include all market's correct? So the term \"black market\" is just a label that's been affixed to deem it as outside. Like I said before, it new here. The currency, the site...everything. SR does listen, it is more or less a community driven site were ideas are taken to heart I feel. But for me I fear the STATE taking away everything I care for and believe in...they can and will if they got the chance. So that's why I feel so many measures should be taken to protect us. That being said, I'm also actively participating...I want to be apart of this, and not just for the good weed! Good post\n",

If all our knowledge of reality is based in sensorial experiences, the concept of Maha Maya may be true, and is valid by quantum physics theories.My point is that if everything is an illusion, why spend time searching anwsers in the external world, if Truth is inside us? Why give SR a goal if doesn't need to have one? Why cant be the goal only use drugs to have feelings that can lead us to oblivion or heaven? Why you people need to have objetives and forget to really live? The selling of guns, the LE, CP, etc, all of them are things that you lose your time and mind thinking and you may forget to search another things, like using DMT to heal yourself, or using opiates to understand the true sensation of relaxing.You say that we, drug users, are here for drugs and drugs only, but I'm here for the truth behind this big illusion, having new feelings and experiences that go beyond your \"long term project for SR\".Don't think this is an attack or offense, this is only my opinion, and I trully want you to do whatever you want, and be happy and have love in your life.

Don't worry about him.Peace and LoveDude, I'm sorry but that is essentially another devolving of human potential into post-modern drivel.  It always takes that same form, the same subjective tone.  Look, the fact of the matter is there are universal, quanifiable facts to life.  If you dont' eat, you will starve to death.  If you don't drink water, you will die of dehydration.  If you enact a state, eventually mass violence and mass murder will be a part of life.  If you take 3g of herion you will most likely die.  The fact of the matter is that, while there is certainly a spiritual element to the possession of a soul, something humans seem to solely possess in this physical realm, it makes up a vastly small portion of our lives.  If we spend all of our time focusing on it, we end up being bums in the street contributing nothing to our fellow man.Goals are good.  Understanding cause and effect of all human interactions, as well as the universal motivation behind them, is good.  Universal constants are good, they give you something to take for granted (we all as humans do 99.9% of the time) so that you can function outside of those things.  That is an old way of thinking, brother, and the most prominent figures in history who subscribed to it either used state coercion to subsidize their lifestyles, or ended up philosophizing from the gutter with an ever-present wine bottle in rapt attention.....\n",

In other terms, everything has an Essence, the One, God, whatever you want. So, if everything has god, nothing is wrong or right, there is no Evil or Good. Maha Maya is broken when one find the Essence.One thing that you didin't quite get it is that there is no need for goals. There is no Evil, there is no Good, only illusion and Truth. You can choose live the illusion or not, you can choose accept the Truth or not, its your choice, not mine. You ask me whats the point of life, I say \"only you can find it\". People today love to talk about their finding of God or something like that, but the Truth is inside you, and thats my point. You said that we all need food to live, but there is some mistics that only have sunbaths for food, and try to live like plants. So, again, who is right? Does it matter or not? Nothing matters, using drugs make you see that, or at least give you an glimpse. If you guys want, I can make another topic explaining what I thing of drugs and etc. But my point is that SR doesn't need a goal, just need to live freely. If is destroyed, we can rebuild.Quote from: Spunkaroo on September 06, 2011, 09:49 amAll I'm going to say to that is the philosophy is definitely interesting. However getting too sucked into that seems like an easy way to avoid living your life if you ask me. I mean if nothing's real, what is the point of doing anything at all? I'm of the opinion the entire universe is simply a complex chemical reaction still trying to reach equilibrium, and that does bring up some big questions about free will and the meaning of life, but I'm sure not going to waste the time I have in this life worried about. Life is way too short.And using drugs isn't a way of avoiding your life? Talking about others isn't a way of avoiding yourself? I can think about millions of things that make us avoid something. One thing is that you, once create concience about it, about the \"avoidance\", you become free of it. It's not a matter of fighting against it, it is a matter of creating concience about it.Life isn't short, because is eternal. You live in Maha Maya, this life that you know is an illusion. You can belive it or not, you will still be on it. Seeking the Truth is the true finding of \"Life\", and for that, you have to look to yourself.Peace and Love\n",

      "\t\t\t\tI  totally agree with Anarcho on the need to address this immediately as a community. I do have some questions:The main question is have all the discovered vulns been confirmed fixed? I think this is very important and I wish SR would post in this thread. Even just an \"aware and on top of it\" note. Also, what can we do proactively? actually start pen-testing the site and look for more issues to compile a list that will be presented to SR and/or the community? I would contribute BTCs if there's a collective effort to pay a reputable, symphatetic security pro to inspect and implement improvements.  Or SR could let trusted members who are also coders to look at the application (not the actual database) and give it a proper audit.I'm obviously also sensitive to the need for secrecy and understand that a closed system (\"release as little info as possible\") has its advantages. However the OP did raise serious issues that concern us all. I guess I agree that there needs to be action on this, I'm just not sure what that would be, especially without SR's cooperation. I think OP's idea of open-sourcing the code that runs the site and setting up a \"paranoid system\" like what lookbehindyou described may be the best way in the long run. Again, we could all contribute time/knowledge/money to such effort. But that's for another discussion. Back to the question: anything we users can do now? \n",

Since \"LexieSadie\" isn't a human per se, it's a pseudonym that a human (or group) uses to do business, there's only so much you can do to validate that.So, I went into GPG Keychain Access, and signed her key with that of the buyer account I used with LexieSadie. I set the verification level to 'casual', given the above.Here's the revised key:-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)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ex2Z-----END PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----Try importing it. You'll see that it is indeed the same key as the previous one, it just has a new signature for the primary UserID.LexieSadie could also sign *my* public key as someone she has successfully completed as a transaction with. I could then use that revised public key in new communications with sellers, who'd see definitive proof that the person they know as LexieSadie has some trust in me, and use that as part of their decisionmaking for whether to trust me as a buyer.I should underscore here that you should NOT \"early sign\" a key. You should only do it when you have some level of proof that the person is who they say they are.2. So, what's the maximum amount of proof that a given PGP key is \"real\"? This is a question of what the likely attack scenarios are. Let's go through them.SR Admin:a) Site has an SQL injection exploit or similar vulnerability that allowed an attacker to completely dump its database, allowing them to put up a new hidden service (say, silkroadvb5piz3r.onion) with all that info intact. Limitation: they would not have access to SR's private PGP keys, unless they're a total idiot and storing them on the server rather than somewhere independent and safe.b) Site has a MITM attack, aka the usual phishing method. Attacker puts up a new hidden service (say, silkroadtherealthign.onion). Since they don't have the DB, what they do is just proxy all requests to the real site. This adds a delay, but since we're dealing with Tor, delays are not suspicious. The phisher's site could then steal all transparent info (eg passwords) and all database info (by scraping what users see). Limitations: same as above, plus the added delay.c) SR has been compromised IRL by the police, who have forced them to hand over their PGP private keys and passwords, database, hidden service ID/secret keys, etc, in return for more lenient sentencing and the ability to get lots of info about drug smugglers (aka all you lovely sellers). They continue operating the site exactly as usual. They can sign with SR's PGP key and do everything else they did.Limitations: unless they have SR's active cooperation, they might make mistakes replicating their writing style. Also, if there were any out-of-band secrets passed that they *didn't* manage to capture (ie they weren't on whatever machines they compromised, and SR the human didn't blab about them), then they wouldn't know those secrets.Ways to prove the PGP is legit against a & b: post a signed message on the front page of every legit SR URL ever (current and previous), saying \"The correct SR URL is blahblahblah.onion\". Also list SR's public key with all current signatures. The key will change regularly as new signatures are added, but its ID, fingerprint, etc core properties will not change.Ways to protect against c: If compromise is suspected, someone who has an out-of-band secret (eg communicated via some other Tor service the feds didn't know about and/or weren't able to get records of) can challenge the SR admin to decrypt a PGP message signed with that as a symmetric key.For example, suppose SR and I had chatted on another Tor service. They validated with the same PGP key as now, and said eg \"My granduncle has a mole on his left eyelid.\" I note down this information privately and date it.Now suppose sometime later, I suspect SR has been fully compromised and is now actually the feds. The feds don't know this secret, since it wasn't in any of the logs they got, and SR didn't mention it to them.What I can do is post the following challenge publicly:\"If you are the real SR: remember the conversation we had? Decrypt this message using the key \"[relative]-[distinguishing mark]-[location]\", no spaces.\" (I.e. \"granduncle-mole-lefteyelid\")I create a signed message like so (gpg -a --clearsign -s -u FFB74377):-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1Whoever decrypted this was Silk Road as of 2010-4-23.  -----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG/MacGPG2 v2.0.17 (Darwin)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uWwr-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----This message itself can be proven legit by anyone who trusts key FFB74377.I don't post *that* message, of course.

Since the passphrase is based (hopefully) on a secret that only I and SR share, that proves that they are in fact SR (as of the date I received the secret). They can prove this easily by decrypting it and posting the previous, clearsigned statement. Try it for yourself.Sellers: a) Cops or phishers are performing a MITM attack. They post their own PGP key, pretending it's the seller's. When the buyer sends them their info, they decrypt it and send it to the real seller (with a new key pretending to be the buyer, just like mine above pretending to be SR), and vice versa. In other words, they just MITM the PGP conversation.Limitation: they don't actually have the seller nailed IRL; they only have either compromised their SR account or the SR site itself. So they can't control what the seller does IRL.b) Cops have completely compromised the seller IRL. They continue operating their business as usual to get more info before prosecutions. They have the seller's real PGP key and secret, samples of their packaging, everything.Limitations: they may not have access to the seller's supply chain (unless the seller ratted 'em out), so once they run out of the seller's stockpile, they'll have to start using product they get from elsewhere, and buyers might notice this. They might not replicate the seller's communication style well (this is more subjective). And the same thing as above about secrets.There's an easy, definitive defense against (a): the seller includes a small message printout in their package, signed with the PGP key you posted on their seller account. It doesn't need to say anything substantive, but it MUST include the current date (e.g. \"Thanks! Shipped 1 Dec 2011\"). This proves that the person who packed the product (who is the \"real\" seller when it comes down to it) owns the PGP key that was published.If they get a slip with an implausibly old ship date, that's a red flag for compromise.*Weak* (non-definitive) proof that the seller owns the PGP key is receiving product without that slip. This only proves that the message encoded to that PGP key got to the seller and was acted on — it doesn't rule out a MITM attack like in (a).(b) can only be defended against by being (subjectively) suspicious of a change in product or communication style, or using the shared-secret method above.Buyers: This one is hard, in that the only thing you get from buyers is payment. You have no way to prove that they're a real buyer and not a cop, that they actually received the envelope you sent (vs it going to some police warehouse and the buyer pretending it's all good), etc.There are however a couple methods.a) Successfully receiving payment from a buyer proves only that they are able to pay. This is a weak proof of their identity, but it's at least something.b) Sellers can include a UNIQUE serial number slip on the inside of each package. Buyer then sends you signed a message saying \"I received a package with serial number 12381238\". This proves at least that they have some control over the receipt of the package, and that the package was not intercepted en route by the postal inspectors and then sent on its way. It doesn't prove that the buyer themselves isn't a cop, of course.To be really secure, this requires using packaging that's truly tamper-evident AND hard for the PIs to duplicate. That's relatively difficult; you have to have some source of bags or stickers that the PIs don't.This is a moderate proof of their identity.I'm not sure how to authenticate the identity of a buyer any better than that.So there you go: an expert's advice for how to really prove you're you when we're all anonymous.Do with it what you will.\n",

US and Mexico, or US and Colombia will cooperate, but for the US to cooperate with all the involved countries here? That would be a logistical nightmare. Maybe this isn't the best argument, though.QuoteNot if they have any modicum of intelligence. If you shut a darknet site down, a new one pops up instead.No, what you do is you compromise it and keep everything running like normal for long enough until you're ready to make a big, simultaneous bust with plenty of evidence. Example: that's what happened to a certain well-known carder forum.My argument here isn't that shutting us down would be most intelligent, I'm arguing that it is most likely. Those senators a while back told the DEA to \"shut it down.\" Shutting us down would appease the higher ups and would cost tens of thousands of dollars versus the tens of millions it would cost to run an intricate sting with evidence collection and simultaneous busts.QuoteDepends. Sellers of grams are likely to either store kilos or have a supplier who does. That's how it always goes. They're happy to bust anyone who could lead to a larger bust.True, most large busts start low, but your argument can be made for ANY drug exchange anywhere. The half gram of coke I can get at the street corner must have gotten there from some large smuggling operation. Does that mean the DEA is busting me or my dealer on the corner? Nope.QuoteTalking about it in the hypothetical? Not illegal. Arranging an actual sale? TOTALLY ILLEGAL and definitely probable cause. So is admission of guilt (eg saying you have bought/sold x). Getting a search warrant (assuming they could track you down, which is the only hard part, and it's been discussed how they could do that w/ fake buys) would be trivial.Arranging a sale/admitting guilt is NOT illegal unless there are physical drugs involved. Walk into your local police station (with no drugs on you or in your home) and tell them you bought a quarter ounce of weed a week ago. Then tell them you smoked some and sold some to a few friends. I bet you they'll laugh in your face and tell you to leave.QuoteWhen juries don't understand something, they almost always side with authority. Consider the outcome ratio of pure cop-said/citizen-said cases. Cops ALWAYS win those.Not true at all. The burden of proof lies with the prosecution. It's a pretty successful defense strategy to muddle details and confuse the jury. If the jury is confused about the technical details it's easier to plant some reasonable doubt, i.e. DNA evidence is sometimes called into question because defense attorneys poke holes in the technical and statistical issues that really aren't there to begin with.\n",

The feds are very picky, if they open a case they want to convict for sure without a doubt. What that means is that feds usually target 2 kinds of people by obligation, those who are easy to bust and those who are dealing in large amounts. If you wish to avoid LE while on SR then only deal with amounts that are under trafficking amounts AND make sure that you are not the easiest person to bust using SR.

      "\t\t\t\t-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1- From it's humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters.  From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome.  Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us.It didn't take long before word got out.  Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement.  But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.  It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.  We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.  A revolution has been born.  So ideally, more participants means more prosperity.  What we've found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.So, we've had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.  One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war.  This is always and ever a top priority.  The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point.  The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few).  And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.This success has in no way made us complacent however.  New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and “finalizing early”, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice.  Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved.First we must deal with trading out of escrow.  Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.  This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system.  Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it.We've worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow.  For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates:eBay     - $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.  The average response looked like this:15% of the first $1011% of $10 - $508.14% of $50 - $2505.6% of $250 - $10003.7% of $1000 - $5000We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:10% of the first $508.5% of $50 - 1506% of $150 - 3003% of $300 - 5002% of $500 - 10001.5% for everything over $1000With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.  Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.  We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.  If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)iQEbBAEBAgAGBQJPCl0BAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olWDsH9jGBcHVl302TYnOpD/oc2G9wZN1H56v/oRww3het2ESSUokjfoU3JFs5442eNvvNQohHlN3Z2gVBpm4c7BQKVBTBIlfjalIMr1bzMtjVzvwV+CJSF7KHrz91eUDICtpOgNIVQ36CxYA1c9cjHuOVVNbU6N6qVycC4TS2Oy38DUJlYm5UsLcxTqQhlLkiXuUH3uOMp7pwLfPlDmrz4nojWooqFwQ6JBFuMG5/wO0NcKgP4hXWcAmo24oGbaC6/5jUjQ7ze7ILsZf7ykeOi3O3ZhyGn2WyY5+99dc39kviJhIwQfvu8VWaDlYBgvh3PlDENIYD4ThgAzdUoW0Nha4LXA===wI/M-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----CLARIFICATION:  The new policy regarding out of escrow transactions stated in this address does not affect a vendor's ability to ask their customers to finalize their orders and release payment before shipment.  We still strongly recommend that buyers avoid doing this at all costs because we will be unable to protect you in case of fraud.CLARIFICATION:  This new policy also does not affect vendors who use the market as a platform for Bitcoin exchange.  They may continue to operate as usual, but again we strongly recommend that you purchase bitcoins through a non-anonymous vendor because the market is not set up to facilitate bitcoin exchange and your money can be stolen without recourse.FURTHER COMMENTARY: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8539.0\n",

It is time, definitely, for some cleansing before more legit vendors and buyers who are tired to be ill-treated decide to retire from the arena coz you are going to end up making money on real dirty money, what an achievement..!!! I amplify it obviously but there is such a lack of true Spirit atm on SR, i wish you can implement some new rules to facilitate  the good work of the good vendors, to protect them as much as they deserve it to make sure they will remain within SR ranks and not at the contrary to be constraint to quit as it is already the case. I had such a great impression of SR when I first came, i gotta confess that the only positive aspect that remains in my mind now is only about the very good people I came across...of a very small community which makes a H of a difference.With much respect to the true Spirits of this small community and to all the vendors of the other communities, I wish you to stand up for your rights and to fight to get the best of it because without you SR would worth shit.. sorry I would have stayed if only the Spirit was true...  . n .   \n",

$1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.  The average response looked like this:15% of the first $1011% of $10 -

      "\t\t\t\tThis OOE ban is hard to swallow, especially for B2B. As an OVDB guy making the transition to SR, I gotta say, *forcing* the use of escrow chaffs my ass. I didn't come here looking for this petty boutique action. I want a trusted vendor I can rely on to supply sheets and ounces at a good price. At OVDB, I had that: someone I could trust enough to send $2k and rely on to deliver without even having to worry about tracking and signing for packages and all that shit. As many have pointed out, banning OOE doesn't stop scamming. There's no way in hell a vendor's gonna send me an order like that without getting paid up front. Either via OOE or FE, I still have to risk getting ripped off. However, after giving it some considerable thought, banning OOE may still be the best course of action for two reasons. One, it at least forces all scamming into the public review of the escrow system. And two, at least one tangible benefit of all scam transactions will occur: at least SR will have gotten a cut, and can apply that revenue towards future solutions. It won't eliminate fraud, but it at least applies additional pressure against it. Banning B2B OOE between trusted vendors still don't seem right, though.As for SR ramping up the revenue, IMO this is a good thing. We can have a lot more confidence in an enterprise employing several full time sysadmins, security engineers, programmers and administrative personnel.\n",

      "Quote from: watertiger on January 14, 2012, 01:49 amBoth OOE and \"finalize early\" are tricks that allow vendors to rip sellers off. Either one requires the buyer to send cash/bitcoins and merely hope for delivery. If we want to remove the seller/scammers, they should both be banned.Selling OOE harms buyers, but it also it harms SR (since he gets no 10% cut), so he has banned it.  Requiring buyers to \"finalize early\" hurts buyers just as much, but doesn't harm SR (since he gets his cut -- even if the deal turns out to be a scam), so he has let it go on for now for now.If this place wants to establish a fair buyer/seller equilibrium, it will ban not only OOE, but also any sort of \"must finalize early\" type sellers.As a buyer, I can't agree with that. Legitimate vendors are prone to attack by reverse scammers just as much if not more so than we, as buyers, are prone to vendor scams. Think about it. If you were a big dope dealer, are you gonna send someone a bunch of dope and just hope they pay you? Fuck no. You get paid first, then you deliver.Sure the escrow idea works for the boutique market business, < $100. A vendor might risk delivering 5 - 10 hits of LSD or up to a gram of E up front at a hefty retail price. Exactly like we see is the most common transaction on SR. But there's no way in hell these guys are going to risk sending you a sheet or an oz without payment up front. Not unless there's been some serious level of trust established over time. They would be stupid to do so. You want real, full on escrow, it's gotta go both ways. You gotta middle man the coin AND the dope. And that's not gonna happen. SR might as well buy up all the dope and be the damn vendor, lol.The way this is supposed to work is the buyer takes the risk. He either gets his shit or he doesn't. And he reports the results so that if he's been ripped off, everyone else knows not to trust this vendor. And if he got proper, he lets everyone know this vendor is legit. Unfortunately, this is the ideal arrangement. It's as good as it gets. The reality is a little more complicated because you have more complex levels of scamming on both sides of the fence. Apparently good buyers who occasionally lie about not receiving a shipment when they actually did, and apparently good vendors who occasionally rip off buyers, usually who are new to the community, whose calls of \"scammer\" might be portrayed as the rantings of a reverse scammer. Then there's the vendors who build up a lot of reputation, then take payments for as long as they can and just stop delivering until their shits called out and someone would just have to be stupid to send them any more money. Every now and then,  God sends us an angel who actually believes in the liberation of the minds of the masses, who actually believes in karma and has no ill will or bad intentions towards his loving followers, who takes small profits to give good deals, relying instead on massive volume to make bank, and he can do that because he's either getting direct from the manufacturer, no other middleman, or he actually is the manufacturer. And all the other vendors hate him and conspire to destroy him until eventually this kindhearted soul trusts the wrong person and he gets snitched out and ends up dead or in prison for the rest of his life.So, no. You can't ban finalizing early. Banning OOE, while it does chaff the ass as an infringement upon our freedom, does have more residual benefit for the community than not banning OOE. It doesn't prevent fraud, but it does at least apply some pressure against it.\n",

      "Quote from: respect on January 14, 2012, 12:44 amThis OOE ban is hard to swallow, especially for B2B. As an OVDB guy making the transition to SR, I gotta say, *forcing* the use of escrow chaffs my ass. I didn't come here looking for this petty boutique action. I want a trusted vendor I can rely on to supply sheets and ounces at a good price. At OVDB, I had that: someone I could trust enough to send $2k and rely on to deliver without even having to worry about tracking and signing for packages and all that shit. As many have pointed out, banning OOE doesn't stop scamming. There's no way in hell a vendor's gonna send me an order like that without getting paid up front. Either via OOE or FE, I still have to risk getting ripped off. There are vendors here that will send $2k+ product without seeing a dime up front. Its a beautiful thing and a trust I totally respect. If it is inconceivable for you to shaft a vendor even when you know you could quite easily,  it will not take long to build this trust with a vendor.Quote from: respect on January 14, 2012, 12:44 amHowever, after giving it some considerable thought, banning OOE may still be the best course of action for two reasons. One, it at least forces all scamming into the public review of the escrow system. And two, at least one tangible benefit of all scam transactions will occur: at least SR will have gotten a cut, and can apply that revenue towards future solutions. It won't eliminate fraud, but it at least applies additional pressure against it. Banning B2B OOE between trusted vendors still don't seem right, though.As for SR ramping up the revenue, IMO this is a good thing. We can have a lot more confidence in an enterprise employing several full time sysadmins, security engineers, programmers and administrative personnel.+10\n",

      "\t\t\t\tWhile I stumbled upon silk road quite some time before the original Gawker article, if it wasn't for that very article I probably wouldn't have taken the initiative to figure out how everything works and actually join (at least, definitely not when I did). So for that little push in incentive, I thank Gawker.However, now that I'm pretty well-versed in the ins and outs of silk road, and now that I've placed many, many orders and only use sr for all of my little drug desires, I cringed and almost couldn't read the entirety of this new article. While I don't really think the publishing of this article and silk road going down today was anything but a really unfortunate and really poorly timed coincidence, the article is bound to bring at least some unnecessary and unwarranted scrutiny and press. Since I've been a buyer, I've always firmly stated that, since this market is so much smaller and much less responsible for violence than the various cartels/drug empires around the world, and since there is a pretty decent amount of security and anonymity on this site, the federal government simply won't designate the resources it would need to fully crack down on silk road and totally kill the site. Even with this most recent article (drugs are bad enough, but now people can buy GUNS online!? THINK OF THE CHILDREN) might provoke a more serious interest in silk road in the people who eventually forgot about the summers' article, I just don't think that the feds will really crack down. I mean, they might step up scanning packages and letters to try and curtail traffic, but (and I risk sounding cocky here) for every package the government intercepts, the vendors learn far too quickly how to avoid detection again than the gov't can keep up with. Now I could be TOTALLY off here, but the way I see it is that the federal governments' attitude towards silk road is that if a vendor and/or buyer makes a careless mistake which basically screams \"I buy/sell drugs! Look at how I use the USPS as my personal drug courier!\", then they'll step in and put some form of pressure on the buyer/vendor. And, of course, if an illicit substance is detected when it comes across the border, they'll confiscate it, and possibly place a \"double check this guy's mail\" warning on the buyers deliveries. However, unless the vendor is selling massive amounts of drugs in huge quantities, or the buyer is buying massive amounts of drugs in huge quantities, the fact that a large amount of orders are of comparitively unimportant amounts (vs. the unbelievable volume of the same drugs that cross the mexican/american boarder each day, for example) makes it so that if the government tried to seriously crack down, it would wind up costing them a ridiculous amount of money. Add this to what I stated earlier about how the vendors and buyers consistently learn from the (far and few between) mistakes that are bound to happen eventually and implement newer and more discreet tactics, and it just makes it seem like, at the end of the day, silk road is just simply not worth the time, money and effort. Personally, I don't have any ethical or moral issue with private ownership of fire arms. I've shot guns at a range before, and it can be damn fun. I would even go so far as to say that the rush from firing a 12 gauge shotgun or a .50 cal revolver at a target or at skeet rivals and in some cases surpasses the rush from some of the drugs I've taken. Politically, I consider myself to be more or less \"liberal\", but I'm also a die-hard supporter of the protection of our constitutional rights (I'm specifically talking about the United States constitution, so I'm sorry for those of you who aren't US citizens if this doesn't really ring any bells), and unlike many of the hypocritical \"democrats\" I know personally and in office who spout off the significance of civil liberties, but when the 2nd amendment comes up suddenly become vehement supporters of restrictions and, if some had their way, total illegality, I feel just as strongly about the right to bear arms as I do about the right to free speech and the right to protection against self-incrimination. I'm not trying to turn this in to a political discussion (because god knows that if I was we might as well kiss any sense of order and structure that this thread has goodbye)...but rather I'm giving background to my stance on this Guns vs. No Guns issue.  On one hand, the introduction of guns on the silk road marketplace inevitably brings with it another level of hatred. It's bad enough that the drugs bring with them a viciously negative stigma from people who will never cease to let go of their indoctrinated hatred towards anything deemed an \"illegal drug\"...but adding on to that the hatred and attention of the rather large number of hypocritical democratic politicians and over-protective, ill-informed stay-at-home suburban moms is just an honestly really unwise decision. Sure, you could probably make a pretty hefty sum of cash by selling guns on here. And sure, if the federal government gets enough complaints and decides to actually step in and shut down silk road for good and you are able to cash out before everything goes to shit, you could at least have an extra amount of money. But, for people like me, the longer this site remains active, and the longer we're able to avoid the full force of the Law, the better for all of us. For those like me, this site isn't about making money, it's about establishing what is basically the first real attempt at a drug trade that is set up like a legitimate business as opposed to a violent, prone-to-breaking-its-rules drug empire. The whole system of user reviews, escrow and anonymity, combined with the fact that I know if I order MDMA from DrAmsterdam, I will get nothing more than MDMA (vs on the street where I'll most likely wind up with some combination of amphetamines, caffeine, an MDMA analogue with no research and no one knows what it actually does) has very quickly led to me only buying drugs from here. The last time I actually physically went out and bought drugs from some street-vendor was so long ago that I honestly don't remember when. Although the addition of guns adds another level of scrutiny, it is by no means going to bring about the total end of silk road. It might contribute to this, but no one will ever be able to look back and say \"Silk road was fine and it was never going to be shut down until those damn gun heads came to the scene\" if they are really any smart at all. If the government doesn't shut down silk road, either the (highly unlikely) total legality of all drugs will, or the appearance of a newer, more secure, more stable market or markets will. The fact that the addition of guns will most likely not spell the end for silk road leads to my other viewpoint on this whole thing.On the other hand, stemming from my complete support of private gun ownership, and due to the fact that you can already buy not only a vast majority of illegal drugs, but also porn, games, software, paraphernalia, banned books, and tutorials and equipment needed to make drugs on silk road....I don't really see the addition of a substantial \"Guns\" section to really be that out of place. In the public's eye, whenever guns and drugs are mentioned in the same sentence, even the same paragraph, the immediate reaction is fear and crying for the government to step in and get rid of these \"gangsters\". However, just as the silk road marketplace differs from the cartels in the drug trade by having a unique system which makes it operate like a legitimate and well-renowned business, I don't really think that all of a sudden just because vendors now offer guns all sense of order and legitimate business go flying out the window. Like the vendor stated in the Gawker article, he would do everything he could to ensure that the people he was selling the guns to had no intentions of using them for violence or were mentally/emotionally unstable in any way. Now of course, any vendor could say that they operate by those rules, but in reality don't care in the slightest who they're doing business with, which is the only real big and difficult to solve flaw I find in the pro-gun side. But, if this was somehow dealt with and the Guns were here to stay, the vendors would fall in line with the established system/guidelines extremely quickly. Another concern that could be brought up is the issue with why anyone might want to purchase a gun illegally rather than go through the legal process. To that, I'd say it wholly depends on where the person is located and subsequently how restrictive their government is. One thing that the vendor in the Gawker article pointed out that I found to be a very reasonable, if not totally logical, argument was how he saw himself as providing the means for the civilians of any country to procure an instrument to defend themselves as per their right to do so. As an American, I'm lucky enough to not really know what it's like to not be able to go out and purchase my own personal fire arm without too much difficulty. However, in other countries, the civilians are either extremely restricted, or outright cannot own fire arms. While the Vendor from the article said something about \"citizens protecting themselves against overbearing governments\", and while I do consider that a very important part to maintaining a free and non-repressive society, the most immediate and probably biggest concern is the fact that, despite gun ownership being illegal, criminals are going to procure fire arms regardless, while the citizens are forced to rely on the effectiveness of law enforcement. If you were to ask me, if someone with a gun broke in to my house, I would grab MY gun, call the police, then defend myself if needed. Personally, as an American, I just wouldn't find the benefits of purchasing a gun from a silk road vendor to really outweigh the risks of what would happen if I was caught with an illegally owned firearm. When I turn 21, I fully intend on purchasing a hand gun, and applying for a concealed-carry permit. There's no way in hell I'm going to let some low-life junky get away with my wallet/possessions while I wait helplessly at their mercy for the police to show up. If someone tries to take my things and pulls a gun out on me, you absolutely bet that I will not hesitate to make them know that they're not the only ones with a fire arm. And of course, like I said, guns are just really, really fun when handled properly and intelligently. Plus, it's another whole new market to attract vendors and buyers...and from there, some vendors might start adopting other products when they see how diverse the playing field is. And some buyers may see something in another market that piques their interest, leading to a growth in the number of buyers in total, and subsequently leading to some vendors increasing their earnings. Sorry about the depth and length of this message, but I just felt like it wouldn't hurt to express my personal opinion on this issue. And from what I've seen, this could be a very decisive point in Silk Road's history. I hope that something that I brought up rings true to anyone's feelings on this matter...but even if there are things with which you disagree, the only way we're going to be able to come to any sort of more-or-less majority supported decision is if we come together and try to find some sort of middle ground. If we continue to totally disagree with each other and no one on either side tries to see the other side's arguments in any accepting and understanding way, then this fight could potentially cause a very damaging rift in the community. I like to think of this community as a group of very intelligent, very rational and very realistic people who aren't completely blinded by their personal beliefs and self-righteous hatred of those of opposite or different beliefs. I like to think that we all want to see Silk Road continue to be as reliable and professionally-run as it is, and hopefully improve to levels we can't imagine in the future. I'd like to think that the people on both sides of this argument are more than capable of recognizing their emotional reasons for what they believe, but can leave these irrational feelings behind and come together and acknowledge what the other side believes and why. And hopefully, I believe that we will be able to come to a final decision which pleases as many people as possible, while alienating as few as possible. Maybe when some of us go on 4chan, or reddit, or somethingawful, or whatever forum, we'll engage in and/or spark flame wars...but on Silk Road, I really think we need to leave the flame wars to the surface web. It is pretty much an unwritten rule of the internet that, no matter how good or how well thought out your argument might be, there is no possible way to \"win\" an online argument. Just my 2 cents....or more like 200 pages. But I really don't want to see silk road torn apart from the inside because no one remembered to leave the flame-war attitude back on the surface web. There's still so much potential for silk road...and the last thing I'd want is for all of it to be wasted along with the single most reliable and professionally run drug business I have ever dealt with. Come on, guys. Let's not overlook just how ridiculously lucky we are to have this service at our fingertips. We would be utterly foolish if we let this go to waste. \n",

Just my two cents.  Id love to hear yours :)thisalso it should be a bit more anonymous too...that way nobody feels pressureed into leaving good feedback; like maybe everynight at midnight everyone page updates with all their feedback from the previous day, idkk thoughOR YOU KNOW WHAT HOWSABOUT SR IS PRETTY DAMN GOOD I FOR ONE AM HAPPY THE WAY IT IS...not the rating just sr in general, i know that's a little off topic\n",

So I figured my order would be processed and shipped Tuesday, and I messaged them Tuesday night explaining that I just read about the 9am policy thing, and was wondering if it had shipped yesterday sometime.So far I have not heard back, and the order is still stuck at processing, so I don't know what's up now, is anyone else having any issues with Pharmville within the past day or two? Normally they are on the ball and get my order out the same day and are able to overnight in some cases. I do still have full faith in them that they will get it out eventually, but as always, it sucks being in limbo.If something has come up, I will certainly understand, but just please let me know if there's some issue preventing you guys from fulfilling your orders at the moment, thanks.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tBy the way, the DEA considers a DTO (Drug Trafficing Organization) \"large\" if it has around 1000 members worldwide... so we both know there is well over a 100x that here...  and even if you excluded all the non-active accounts and went with the real figures of somewhere around 25,000 regular active members we make up one of the largest and most resilient DTO's in the world.We waaayyyyyy past the point of hiding...  besides hiding is for prey and Im more of a predator myself.And since you have established no private place to discuss this, Im just going to talk to you about something a little different right here that's been on my mind for a while now:  you should have two separate teams of legal counselors by now.  How do I know you dont?  Easy:  You opened a separate website selling guns of all things thereby creating a major change in your status from \"a lone website engaged primarily in drug trafficking\" to a \"continuing criminal enterprise with expanding vistas\" better known as a CCE and now your the 'Mastermind' (yes, that's a major sentencing enhancement as well).  Your lawyers would have dragged you kicking and screaming if necessary away from that idea... all to give the thin veil of not selling guns on SR?   Ummm yeh right everyone really believes you don't have nothing to do with selling guns.  Nothing wrong with selling guns at all but the way you went about it is legally far more treacherous and politically paper-thin.  All of which was the result of a knee-jerk reaction to the free-fall outcome of SR's negative media exposure from the Gawker article and mounting pressure from people whom have nothing at all to lose by pressing you to move the sale of guns off-site so they \"feel better about buying drugs.\"  I sell and buy drugs all the time with guns around, it makes everyone more comfortable actually because everyone knows if someone starts some bullshit it could go really really wrong real fast... so nobody ever does.  Mostly everyone I know that moves weight has guns as well for insurance so everyone is already supporting guns by proxy anyways whether they know it or not.  Its kinda like Switzerland:  Everyone has guns so crime rate is low.. why?  Cause everyone knows everyone else defiantly has guns and knows how to use them.So, one team for criminal indictment avoidance (yes, its their job to help guide you and keep you out of trouble or at least minimize your exposure if you hire them *before* you find yourself in trouble) and one that specializes in managing your media relations which I might be so frank as to say has been less than effective so far in terms of garnering favorable reports...  hell, a recent one on Forbes.com directly links Silk Road to human trafficking and child p*orn which is something that does not even ever happen here to my knowledge (http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/30/how-technology-complicates-the-war-on-drugs-guns-and-drugs-for-sale-online/2/).  One brick thru her window would have gotten that shit edited right out if pursuit of diplomatic solutions did not bear positive results or simply was not possible.  Now how in the world did that shit happen?  I'm guessing your advisers were too busy dreaming up hash algorithms for hiding transaction numbers and such from warweed while the media was boiling Silk Roads members alive, vendors and buyers alike, by painting us all as human traffickers and supporters of child p*rn.  The media can make or break you and valuable opportunities have been squandered away to turn the game around on the jackbooted Law Enforcement baboons that insist on continuing the war on drugs.I dont want to even get into the young kids on SR buying inappropriate things...  or if anything is even being done about that?  I don't know whom your advisers are but I highly recommend that you begin to consider engaging in a private two way dialogue with your partners here on the ground doing the work from day to day... and as I have said several times before perhaps some matters such as these should more appropriately be discussed in a private venue setting.Heres the quote from Forbes.com in qn article written specifically about Silk Road:  \"The internet, and especially dark sites that operate behind the veil of anonymity, give the sex slave trade a huge advantage.  Frankly, I find that pretty terrifying. The cyber-libertarian or cyber-anarchist in us might be sympathetic to online marijuana sales.

frequent buyers.  That's the business we set ourselves up to handle and we both believe we did a very good job of it even up to the point of where it was 5 times that many.  But this model isn't suited for the size that SR is now and it's even worse for the size that SR is going to become in the very near future.  And we'd just be kidding ourselves to think that we can just keep pushing it further and further and still do a good job, not make mistakes, have good security, and keep all the products in stock and keep bringing you new ones.  We've got to start over, from the ground up, and we've got to get some help.  Plus any professional vendor knows that you've got to change up everything from time to time to stay one step ahead of LE.  And we've gone longer than we should have without doing enough of that.  So now we're going to do it entirely, safely and securely.The one regret we have is that we didn't have the chance to give our customers notice, but sometimes you're just trying so hard to make things work right that you don't notice until it's way past time that you've got to change things and change them a lot.  I was working my way through the pm's on Sunday and suddenly the PGP stopped working and I spent around 6 hours getting it back to working condition and that's what made me call Ben and say \"we've got to start over, we can't just be patching this together every time it's not working, or we'll NEVER get on top of this like we used to be\".  So we're going to get all the things we need whether it's people or equipment or whatever so that we can properly service every buyer who wants to purchase from us and we can give them service that is equal to the reputation that we've built so far.  No more 5 days waiting for an answer to a pm.  That's not Pharmville quality service.  And if we stayed open, selling at the rate we've been selling,  we wouldn't have had anything to sell in a few more days and being out of stock on half our items isn't the Pharmville way either.  This all might take 2 weeks or it might take a month.  There are some factors that we can't control as to timing, so we don't know how long they'll take.    But you can be assured that when we return we will have an excellent range of items, that the prices will be reasonable, and that the packaging and service will be top notch.  It occurs to me that with the stealth mode and stealth items that this might be just what was needed to bring about a much more orderly and well disciplined market at SR.  Older vendors could stay in stealth mode and that way moderate the total number of buyers that they service so that they have maximum control over how many orders they receive every day and need to ship.  And it gives newer vendors a chance to work with the absolute flood of new buyers coming on line every week and develop their own regular customer base.  As a salesman it hurts to ever have to turn down someones order but this is the reason that football teams build bigger stadiums and retailers build bigger stores: so they can handle more customers and not have a degradation in their service.  Well, this business isn't any different and, for us at least, it's time for us to stop and assess exactly what it is that we want to be in the world of SR and then how we can best achieve that.I will tell you that a BIG part of our future status is that we will continue to be a 24/7/365 availability vendor to all our loyal customers who have supported us up to now and that if we can we'll be that to a lot of new buyers as well, but we're not going to be chasing after the #1 spot or have one bit of concern where we stand in the vendor rankings.  Our goals are all based around giving the best service, at the best prices, every day, to the people who depend on us for the products.  That is by far and away the main goal.  If we are able to find ways to do that AND be the largest vendor, well, then that's just a bonus.  But if you've been buying from us for any period of time at all then you're our focus and you're the people we are most wanting to take care of and you'll be the ones that are going to *definitely* be on our buyer list when we reopen.  Even if you've only had one order, you're eligible.  Whether or not the new model will allow for all new buyers to order from us depends on a *lot* of factors and if the model won't allow for it then we're going to \"close the gates\" so to speak and only open them on a very intermittent basis when it's clear that we've increased capacity and can handle more volume than we're doing.  We hope everyone is able to manage well buying from our competitors during our absence and we'll be back with you as quickly as we can but only when we're absolutely sure that everything is in place to do the kind of job you've seen us do from the beginning.  As far as Ben and I are concerned, it's either do it absolutely correctly and at a fair price or don't do it at all.  And that's what you'll get from us when we come back.Everyone take care and I want to say as a personal note that I hope over the coming weeks that the buyers and vendors start talking to each other on the forums about ways to better work together and ensure that SR stays in place and prospers and not have so many threads and subjects devoted to adversarial situations.  If you're one of the people who was here when the \"old forum' was in place, you know exactly what I'm talking about: the main topics were not scamming, slamming vendors, complaints, and tons of redundant threads because people weren't willing to even try to find out if their questions had already been asked and answered a dozen times before on the forum.  The threads back then were informative, enlightening, instructional and sometimes incredibly entertaining.   And the 4,000 or so people that were members then had a VERY strong sense of community about this place and they supported and encouraged each other at every opportunity.  That's the way a really great forum works and it's the way that the SR forums *should* work and the way that they would be of the most value to the people who are reading them.  So, if we can, let's work together instead of against one another, and find a way to, thread by single thread, bring back that outstanding sense of community that existed when this place was just a small dot in the .onion ocean.  A person would have to be a fool to deny the benefits of getting a small package in the mail containing exactly the products you desire vs calling around to a bunch of dealers to see who's holding and then running around town trying to score and sometimes even eventually ending up in places you'd thought you'd never find yourself, wondering how you got there, and being very concerned about whether you're going to be leaving in the same condition you arrived.  Doing business on SR avoids ALL of that.  So it is worth something in the way of pricing for all that convenience and safety.   But I'd still like to see the fees lowered and I know that this is a very contentious issue and that DPR has made it clear to me, at least, that it's not going to happen.  Well folks, this place works like any other place that you shop.  IF you think that something should be changed, you write to the management.  DPR may have a new name, but he's still user #1 and if you want to talk to him directly about it, then please do because that's the only way you'll get a situation changed that you don't feel is correct.  Telling the vendors, as so many buyers have told me, that we've raised our prices and how could we go and do that without telling them, isn't the answer.  We DIDN'T raise our prices folks, that's all either bitcoin devaluation or SR fee increases.  I am a firm believer that DPR can make a huge amount of money based on the volume of this site and charge much less in fees than he does at this time.  I wouldn't even be saying this publicly if I thought I had *any* chance of convincing him of this through private conversation.  But I know that's not going to happen and now it's up to you, the buyers and the vendors, to voice yourself and voice yourself loudly if you think the fees are too high.I will give you the same example I gave DPR: I think that buyers who are buying over $1000 of product should have a fee of 3%.  He pointed out to me that the current fee was 3.8% and that did I believe the less than one percent difference really mattered.  But it was not the answer to the question I was asking.  I was talking about a person buying $1000 of say $3.00 items, a quite common occurrence, and he was talking about a person buying one $1000 item.  Something that I don't think happens very often.  The person buying $1000 of $3.00 items is currently paying, I THINK, closer to 8% in fees, but I haven't been able to find a commission schedule to check this out and confirm it, one of the many things I plan to do while we reorganize.As an innovator and for his amazing responsiveness to the needs of the community I have nothing but respect and admiration for DPR.  We vendors know that the improvements have come fast and furious ever since Day One and that sometimes they even were instituted within 24 hours of being first mentioned.  THAT'S great vendor support and that's worth paying for.  But I don't think that using Ebay as your comparative is proper because Ebay rapes it's customers on fees and when you add in the cost of using PayPal on top of it it's plain highway robbery.   Amazon, on the other hand, charges no fees, has the lowest prices in the universe, and gives free shipping on all orders over $25.  I think that if you're really here to serve the buyer community then you've got to look at the Amazon model and ask \"how close can I get to that and still make a reasonable profit for myself\".  Ok, that's MY opinion and that's what I'm going to leave you all with.We'll see you soon and when we do, we'll have some new things that people will be really happy to see,take care,Alex & Ben\n",

You have the right to your property, and I to mine.  We cannot own the same piece of property in full because it is a scarce good (anything that cannot be instantly replicated ad infinitum - e.g. a house, a car, illicit product, your shoes, etc).  So we structure our actions around our property and our self interest and the other rights that our inherent in our humanity.SR is set up the same way.  As the owner of the property (SR, forums), DPR dictates what goes on here.  He has the ability to remove access from anyone not playing by his rules.  He isn't a \"king\" or \"lord\" because he doesn't use violence against those violating his terms, he simply withholds his property from them/bars access.  He has set up a bunch of private \"laws\" that members of this community, who are here 100% voluntarily, must abide by.  We stay here, we play by the rules.  If we don't like the rules, we leave.  It is of benefit to SR to structure the community in such a way that entices people to join and stay and play by the rules and make benefit of this place, as opposed to becoming authoritarian and enacting arbitrary restrictions (no usernames beginning with \"A\", have to make a new account for every purchase, can only post one time per week in the forums, vendor accounts cost $10,000.00, etc.).  This would drive people away.  DPR's self-interest inherently steers him to create a marketplace that welcomes legitimate vendors, discourages scammers (escrow, account bans, the forums and encouraging people to post complaints, etc.).Hans Herman Hoppe is probably the world's foremost authority on Private Law.  I would recommend even checking out a few of his primer essays to understand how praxeology plays out in voluntary human association and how such structures are formed organically.  It's pretty awesome stuff.The rest of the hard-line economics are pretty simple.  Price reaction is fairly swift as vendors can adjust on the spot.  Feedback is quick and very public, which can make or break a vendor.  The market itself is a living place and as participation grows on both seller and buyer side I have noticed prices coming down in specific categories as the margins attract new vendors to meet the burgeoning buyer side.  There are no formal regulatory structures in place except for the mods (who follow the property-owner's guidelines and act as \"managers\", in a sense) and SR admin/DPR.  Vendors are 100% liable for all of the good and all of the bad and the community usually does a good job of keeping them in line or kicking them to the curb pretty quickly.  This is all voluntary association stuff and I would encourage you to read up on rothbardian anarcho-capitalist society to see the metrics at play.One final thing about economics you should understand that most university courses don't teach and most philosophy classes won't touch.  it's simple, foundational, and changes your entire perspective on things once you have realized it.  it is this:**Every voluntary transaction is a good thing.**Let's say I walk into a shoe store and the owner shows me a pair of shoes for $40.00.  I really like them, so I decide to buy them.  I voluntarily trade my $40.00 for the pair of brand new shoes.  In order to have done that, I must have decided that those shoes are worth more to me than the $40.00 I have in my pocket.  If they were worth only $40.00 or anything less, I wouldn't buy them.  At the same time, the store owner, by putting his price at $40.00, is telling me that the $40.00 in my pocket is worth more to him than the shoes he is offering.If we exchange our respective goods (another thing to read up on is money -

      "\t\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\tI consider myself a libertarian and I advocate laissez-faire free market economics for purely moral reasons. Although economics as a social science is fascinating, and I think the United States debt crisis,mortgage crises,etc. is indicative of serious problems with Keynesianism and the artificial manipulation of credit/interest rates, I find the moral argument for a free market to be truly sufficient on its own.First off, I understand government as an institution which has been granted an authoritative monopoly over the use of force in society by the consent of the governed, those who voluntarily pay taxes. The only thing which separates the government from a private company is their right to subject people to force, which is accomplished through the use of prisons and through the use of armed law enforcement officers. If you live in a society which holds freedom to be a god given right, than the one law your government ought to enforce is the rule of voluntarism. Freedom of speech, of association, property rights, contractual obligations, these things must all be protected so long as they are exercised in a manner which does not infringe on the equal right of others. Force must only be used by the government to protect these rights for tax paying citizens. So, in the realm of trade, it seems obvious to me that forcefulness should be used protect honest and informed trade between consenting parties. Fraud is a violation of liberty, theft is a violation of liberty, but voluntary trade is not a violation of liberty. All people should receive equal protection under the law to trade goods and services voluntarily. The notion of equality is what leads me to condemn protectionism, moral legislation, all those nasty things governments feel it is acceptable to do. Some fancy government social scientist might say that in order to strengthen domestic manufacturing industries we should put tariffs on foreign manufactured goods and people will only find it affordable to buy domestic. This may have either good or bad economic repercussions, depending on who you ask, (I would say bad, certainly for consumers) but that is besides the point. There is a moral transgression here. Some people are receiving unequal treatment under the law. Force is being used to promote involuntary trade. This I hold to be morally wrong.And then you get tax policy which targets people's choices, such as outrageously high taxes on cigarettes. I know they are bad for me, but I am choosing to buy them with full awareness of the risks, and who are you to condemn me for that? Its not ok to discriminate against people for things they cant control, like race and gender, but its ok to discriminate based on their choices? The things which truly define their identity? (Choices which do not infringe upon other people's rights) That is bullshit. We on this forum choose to do drugs, which is in theory a truly victimless crime, and they want to put us in jail for it. That is immoral. And I live in Canada so someone might say that if I smoke I will consume more socialized healthcare resources when I get cancer, so I should pay for it in cigarette taxes. Well, I have an answer to that: make people pay for their own healthcare. \"But doesn't everyone have a right to their life? Don't people deserve healthcare if it is possible to give it to them?\" At whose expense do they deserve healthcare? At their own expense or at the VOLUNTARY expense of others, see:charity. No one has a right to take the fruits of another person's labor by force. To quote my favorite author, Robert A. Heinlein: \"TANSTAAFL!\" There ain't no such thing as a free lunch. If you eat lunch and don't pay for it, someone else did, by spending time growing the food, and cooking the meal, and what not. Something never comes from nothing. I would recommend to anyone interested in libertarianism, to read 'The Moon is a Harsh Mistress' by Robert Heinlein. Its my favorite book in the whole world, makes you laugh out loud and shit. I didn't mean to rant so long when I started, I'm supposed to be writing an essay, hope the mailman brings my speed today.I love the silk road. eidt: just thought I would add that I realize morality is totally subjective, a matter of taste really. I am a fan of Ayn Rand but I don't totally buy her philosophical premise. This is just what I believe is right and therefore I am compelled by my conscience to act in accordance with this at all times, and to try my best and convince the rest of humanity to agree.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThank you for expressing a dissenting viewpoint.  I appreciate a civilized debate, so allow me to respond.  Quote from: bitfool on September 23, 2012, 07:15 amSilk road is nice because it's a fuck-you of sorts to the powers that be......but...It will have no impact whatsoever on the so called war on drugs. It's not going to affect government in any meaningful way. Agorism is a pretty lame strategy.  It may even backfire (from the point of view of agorists) and cause the government to ban tor or bitcoin or both. Of course it can be done, just ask ISPs to do a bit of traffic shaping. Lastly, DPR is doing this for the money.Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs.  The effect of the war is to limit people's access to controlled substances.  Silk Road has expanded people's access.  The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles.  Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction.  So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no?  Personally, I don't think they can be effectively banned at this point.  Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing.On your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification.  Money is one motivating factor for me.  If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor.  Money motivates me for two reasons.  For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause.  I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant.  In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally.  I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit.  Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see.  Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here.All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference.  As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people.  It's fulfilling to me.  If you don't know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you.  There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself.  It's paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on other's, the happier you'll be.  Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish :)\n",

I dont think they could ban either of the tools we use simply because tor is to far spread that it would take huge countries agreeing with each other for once and lets face if there just not able to do it at the best of times the software would still get distributed and bitcoins would just be pushed in to an underground market, if made its illegal to own a coin its not really going to bother us is it? the system already exists, people would find a way around it.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on September 23, 2012, 11:06 pmOn your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification.  Money is one motivating factor for me.  If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor.  Money motivates me for two reasons.  For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause.  I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant.  In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally.  I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit.  Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see.  Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here.DPR you fully deserve to have the finer things in life for the happiness you have spread, for every time some one opens there mail and gets that product that a year ago was impossible to get there hands on, and the only changes you have made to your own life is better food and clothes? come on man treat yourself a bit more.

      "Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 amHey gang,I read more than I post in the forum, and my posts are rarely of a personal nature.  For some reason the mood struck me just now to put the revolution down for a minute and just express a few things.  There is a curtain of anonymity and secrecy that covers everything that goes on behind the scenes here.  It is often fast paced and stressful behind this curtain and I rarely lift my head long enough to take in just how amazing all of this is.  But when I do I am filled with inspiration and hope for the future.  Here's a little story about what inspires me:We are upholding a social-digital infrastructure in which we both exist--and do not exist. Anonymity is a highly entropic lifestyle, but it yields vast harvests of intelligence and creativity. The game of thrones is a persistent and ceaseless acquisition of power and security. SR is a kingdom in a land that that is under attack from bigots and businessmen, politicians and Capture Troopers--the Senate and their armies, as in Rome.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 amFor years I was frustrated and defeated by what seemed to be insurmountable barriers between the world today and the world I wanted.  I searched long and hard for the truth about what is right and wrong and good for humanity.  I argued with, learned from, and read the works of brilliant people in search of the truth.  It's a damn hard thing to do too with all of the misinformation and distractions in the sea of opinion we live in.  But eventually I found something I could agree with whole heartedly.  Something that made sense, was simple, elegant and consistent in all cases.  I'm talking about the Austrian Economic theory, voluntaryism, anarcho-capitalism, agorism etc. espoused by the likes of Mises and Rothbard before their deaths, and Salerno and Rockwell today.This is an example of how being a good follower, indeed, creates venerable leaders. Truth comes into our lives in many ways, whether through a new born son or a newly routed server. They both bring happiness into our lives if we seek the Truth--that life should be free and without pain. Pain comes, however, whether we want it to or not: hunger, fear, anger.... One answer to pain is childish curiosity and wonder, patience, and ambition.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 amFrom their works, I understood the mechanics of liberty, and the effects of tyranny.  But such vision was a curse.  Everywhere I looked I saw the State, and the horrible withering effects it had on the human spirit.  It was horribly depressing.  Like waking from a restless dream to find yourself in a cage with no way out.  But I also saw free spirits trying to break free of their chains, doing everything they could to serve their fellow man and provide for themselves and their loved ones.  I saw the magical and powerful wealth creating effect of the market, the way it fostered cooperation, civility and tolerance.  How it made trading partners out of strangers or even enemies.  How it coordinates the actions of every person on the planet in ways too complex for any one mind to fathom to produce an overflowing abundance of wealth, where nothing is wasted and where power and responsibility are directed to those most deserving and able.  I saw a better way, but knew of no way to get there.Meritocracy and a free state.There is a startling historical observation in your words, DPR. The natural philosophers--the Western world's modern social scientists--have mostly been wealthy men, out of which hardly comes freedom and liberty. American founders--terrorists in the eyes of the British at the time, and still to this day--were slave owners. This is not to say that their words are hollow and useless, but that there has been a historical oddity where the rich are those that stake claims to political philosophy and applications.An anonymous marketplace threatens conventional society: Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and all the rest that commit to the Good Ol' Boy system of who you are and where you came from; e.g. George W. Bush, living under the shadows of his father and the Bush Dynasty of Intelligence and Power. Bank of America, Coca Cola, HBSC, the Cartel, American bipartisan corruption, Monsanto, DOW, McDonald's, AT&T, Comcast, etc.How many products suggest or require product registration? Most cell phones are subject to infrastructure contracts and limited consumer control--you do not own the proprietary OS of your own phone? ? ? ? You don't own your privacy; it was sold when you began paying for invasive contracts and restricted services, hidden within thousands of legal and technical pages called a User Agreement--indentured servitude; legal slavery.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 amI read everything I could to deepen my understanding of economics and liberty, but it was all intellectual, there was no call to action except to tell the people around me what I had learned and hopefully get them to see the light.  That was until I read “Alongside night” and the works of Samuel Edward Konkin III.  At last the missing puzzle piece!  All of the sudden it was so clear:  every action you take outside the scope of government control strengthens the market and weakens the state.  I saw how the state lives parasitically off the productive people of the world, and how quickly it would crumble if it didn't have it's tax revenues.  No soldiers if you can't pay them.  No drug war without billions of dollars being siphoned off the very people you are oppressing.For the first time I saw the drug cartels and the dealers, and every person in the whole damn supply chain in a different light.  Some, especially the cartels, are basically a defacto violent power hungry state, and surely would love nothing more than to take control of a national government, but you average joe pot dealer, who wouldn't hurt a fly, that guy became my hero.  By making his living outside the purview of the state, he was depriving it of his precious life force, the product of his efforts. He was free.  People like him, little by little, weakened the state and strengthened the market.It wasn't long, maybe a year or two after this realization that the pieces started coming together for the Silk Road, and what a ride it has been.  No longer do I feel ANY frustration.  In fact I am at peace in the knowledge that every day I have more I can do to breath life into a truly revolutionary and free market than I have hours in the day.  I walk tall, proud and free, knowing that the actions I take eat away at the infrastructure that keeps oppression alive.DPR, your name will live among the greatest men and women in history as a soldier of justice and freedom. I call for DPR tattoos to signify peace, security, and liberty.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts (aka Mortal God of Liberty) on March 20, 2012, 11:39 amWe are like a little seed in a big jungle that has just broken the surface of the forest floor.  It's a big scary jungle with lots of dangerous creatures, each honed by evolution to survive in the hostile environment known as human society.  All manner of corporation, government agency, small family businesses, anything that can gain a foothold and survive.  But the environment is rapidly changing and the jungle has never seen a species quite like the Silk Road.  You can see it, but you can't touch it.  It is elusive, yet powerful, and we are evolving at a rapid clip, experimenting, trying to find sturdy ground we can put roots down in.Will we and others like us someday grow to be tall hardwoods?  Will we reshape the landscape of society as we know it?  What if one day we had enough power to maintain a physical presence on the globe, where we shunned the parasites and upheld the rule of law, where the right to privacy and property was unquestioned and enshrined in the very structure of society.  Where police are our servants and protectors beholden to their customers, the people.  Where our leaders earn their power and responsibility in the harsh and unforgiving furnace of the free market and not from behind a gun, where the opportunities to create and enjoy wealth are as boundless as one's imagination.Some day, we could be a shining beacon of hope for the oppressed people of the world just as so many oppressed and violated souls have found refuge here already.  Will it happen overnight?  No.  Will it happen in a lifetime?  I don't know.  Is it worth fighting for until my last breath.  Of course.  Once you've seen what's possible, how can you do otherwise?  How can you plug yourself into the tax eating, life sucking, violent, sadistic, war mongering, oppressive machine ever again?  How can you kneel when you've felt the power of your own legs?  Felt them stretch and flex as you learn to walk and think as a free person?  I would rather live my life in rags now than in golden chains.  And now we can have both!  Now it is profitable to throw off one's chains, with amazing crypto technology reducing the risk of doing so dramatically.  How many niches have yet to be filled in the world of anonymous online markets?  The opportunity to prosper and take part in a revolution of epic proportions is at our fingertips!I have no one to share my thoughts with in physical space.  Security does not permit it, so thanks for listening.  I hope my words can be an inspiration just as I am given so much by everyone here.Dread Pirate RobertsWe can only go forward from here.Thank you, Dread Pirate Roberts.\n",

Legal weed would be pretty sweet ( sorry SR weed vendors out there).Decriminalization of weed I guess might be easier done than the full blown legal status. And that way SR could possibly still sell it.But the genie is out of the bottle in a way at least in the US with medical states, some day legal weed might go down.Hell, its the one drug you can't overdose on, so its kind of hard to fight against compared to other harder drugs. Even an aspirin overdose could kill you.People have to remember that back in the 70s when head shops were all around major cities, people thought weed would go legal back then too. But in comes a new conservative political change, out with the hippies and in with the yuppies. And all that legalizing weed ideas fell to the side. The same could happen soon again, just when you think the tide is turning, bam! its get these dirty drugs out of here, only prescription drugs sold here.And DPR, you will still have plenty of other stuff on SR, if weed goes legal.

      "\t\t\t\tReally great post, DPR.  This is a perspective that a lot of us don't consider.  A lot of people like the idea of being able to do the things they like without risk of punishment, and are willing the pay a bit extra money and freedom for it.  But even Benjamin Franklin, statist that he was, agreed that \"They who can give up essential liberty to obtain a little temporary safety, deserve neither liberty nor safety.\"We are in a good position to take advantage of this world's failed drug policy, and create a market situation that will overshadow anything the state can attempt to do about it.I also think putting work in to broadening the influence of the BitCoin (and possibly other worthy anonymous/secure currencies) might be worth some of our time.  We are already doing that just by virtue of participating in SR, but it would be nice to try to expand on the \"regular\" goods and services that can be purchased with BTC.  For instance, I would love to see good BTC replacements for both eBay and Craig's List.  This would allow more people to keep more of their money in BTC instead of having to transfer it into cash.  It might help stabilize the BTC while at the same time weakening state-run fiat currencies.(Disclaimer: I'm no economist, so I'm really just guessing.  I would love to be corrected/advised about this kind of thing, though.)Quote from: SuperDerp on April 29, 2012, 07:10 amEnding alcohol prohibition basically ended Al Capone and similar mafia from running entire cities because they were making so much money. Drug legalization is basically the same idea: the cartels won't exist anymore and any mafia or gangs leftover...But the good outweighs any of the bad...  nothing you can do when epic violence is going on everywhere and out of control cartels are building empires or police are terrorizing the public.Prohibition was only lucrative for the mafia because it was dangerous for anyone to produce liquor when it was considered contraband by the state.  If there was no overruling government to decide that no one could drink, then everyone could drink and produce alcohol at their leisure, and the market would decide on the price.  i.e. No one could \"run\" the alcohol market, because anyone could offer it for a lower price than their competitor, until it settles on a natural price that is a reasonable amount above what it costs to produce.Anyway, the state is the biggest, worst mafia out there.  Government is, by definition, a monopoly on violence: only they allow themselves to threaten force and coercion (jail time) to enforce rules that they choose are right.  No one else is allowed by the state to initiate violence or force against another party (without prior permission from the state).Imagine some guy you'd never met knocked on your door one day.  You open the door, and he tells you, \"Hello, SuperDerp.  I'm here to collect the money you owe me,\" and you're like, \"Sorry mate, what money?  I don't even know you.\"  And he says, \"Your protection fee.  You owe me a fee to make sure nobody fucks with you.\"  So you say something like, \"Nah dude, I never agreed to that, and I can take care of myself,\" and he replies, \"No, you did agree.  By virtue of just living in this area, you've already agreed to the terms.  This is my zone, you know?\"  His hand moves to rest lightly on the gun holstered on his hip.  \"Anyway, if you don't pay the protection fee, I'm just going to take it by force, and if you resist, I'll probably lock you in a cage for a while.  So it's easier if you just pay.\"At this point you'd probably wish you could call the cops.  Since he is a cop, you're not really sure who to call.This is pretty much what taxes are.I know some people will gut-react to that, \"No fucking way, that's not anything like taxes.\"  But think about it:If you don't pay your taxes, you'll get some letters about it for a while, and if you ignore them, someone will eventually come to your house.  If you tell them you're not going to pay, eventually some representative of the state with a gun (cop) will come and tell you it's time to come to the cage (jail).  If you refuse, he and his cronies will force you into the cage.  If you fight them, they will shoot you with their guns.Even if you wanted to live unbothered without state benefits, you can't opt out of these rules, because you were claimed as a citizen when you were born.  How?  Because the state, this faceless, personless \"entity,\" has claimed possession of the actual planet surface for many miles around you, and all of the people ever born on it.  And just in case anyone's thinking like a stereotypical American redneck--\"If you don't like 'Merica, you can GET OUT!\"--wouldn't that be fantastic?!  If only there was somewhere else to go...alas, to escape would only put you under jurisdiction of another government with similar rules.Quote from: ConcernedCitizen on April 29, 2012, 08:53 amthe anarchist undertones DPR suggests do not go hand in hand with the SR community.I think they're more anarchist OVERtones, since that's exactly what the post is about.  And that's a really ridiculous thing to claim, since not only did DPR clearly create SR with anarchist intentions, but it is a fantastic example of how anarchy can function successfully and peacefully.  This thing we have here is working example of an anarcho-capitalist society/marketplace, and you're a part of it!  Be proud!\n",
      "\t\t\t\n",

      "\t\t\t\tI feel that following DPRs logic, which is spot on in terms of the direction in which things are headed, there are two routes that can be followed:1) The Gov't takes control of recreational drugs, blends it further into the entertainment industry and in a way everyone wins but certain \"freedoms\" we believe we have will be lost. Such as being on 7 different drugs at once, walking around grabbing every chick in sight and starting fights with people. No one has made it so you can't do this in this scenario, only that you will be punished in a humane way for it.2) We decentralize, corporations profit faster then the gov't and instigate their own local law upon cities and states thru \"lobbying\" until we are no longer viewed as the constituents. It is only a matter of time before either big gov't folds under corporate pressure and prowess, or big gov't continues doing what it has done all these years, attempt to do the will of the people while averting outrageous claims of this or that and creating a level playing field for all below the \"line of gov't power\". Officials will always be bribed and currently it is legal to be bribed and will always be so no matter what type of gov't is involved. Now DPR considers a true anarchical society, this in theory is awesome. I can grow, eat and do whatever I please, but after 6000 years of human societal evolution we have grown to notice a few things of humans:1) Someone always wants more, doesn't care for their health (only the thrill) and doesn't care for your health, this encroaches upon your liberty. With the level of technology this world possesses, it would crumble into a situation reminiscent of sci fi fan fiction. You pick your sci fi story, none will be right but they will properly display the bleakness of this situation.2) People want to band together and live together. People of common interests will always see the need for rules and regulations towards their local areas. I personally believe all gov't should be local and the only time they should convene together or contact each other is in matters of business, land or times of need. 3) Someone will want it all. Not just a thrill, not just a high, someone will want it all. And without even a few centralized bodies that consist of elected officials that represent the local ideals for the people who elected them, the inevitable is crushing, soulless, violent fascism. No one will pick anarchy, safety has grown on us. Sure a small percentage will desire ultimate freedom, a good 30-60% will desire a safe, calm environment for them to grow old in, and the rest will have a hod podge of ideals that may never be realized.I ask you, what is better, everyone has a chance at potentially getting what they want or a handful of people can do what they want, no matter the circumstances.My answer is that regulation is key but no one with more earning potential then the gov't should be calling the shots for us. I have made a few diagrams I will post once I learn to scrub meta data.\n",

      "Quote from: kmfkewm on May 07, 2012, 07:10 amHow many times have UPS or Fedex agents kicked down the door of someone who ordered drugs to send them off the prison? Do you think that Fedex is going to spend their time and money trying to intercept drug packages and arrest the people responsible for sending them and receiving them, if the government does not force them to do so? Of course not, they are a shipping company not a fucking drug enforcement company. what if the mafia controlled drug flow and didn't want people getting drugs from overseas?  they could put pressure on private companies just like the gov't does now.   or what if you had drug users working for the company who looked for drugs to steal?  there would be no serious penalty for it.   you could argue that this is unlikely, but its ridiculous to put any sort of faith or trust into a corporation.or what if you lived in the bible belt and a local anti-fun militia started screening all incoming packages to the town/county/state?  there would be no one there to keep them from doing it except you and a case of molotovs....I'm just saying that its a little bit teenage to think that abolishing government completely would make the world a better place.  without a global spiritual revolution it would just be more of the same, if not worse (IMO).\n",

      "\t\t\t\tGovernments do not want to end prohibition. Politicians do not want to end prohibition.Law enforcement does not want to end prohibition.Drug dealers do not want to end prohibition.Why? Drug trade is driven by capitalistic ideologies and people are more than willing to take the risk involved. Demand is much more than supply and prices, for the most part, can vary from anything. Users will always fill the demand and the only factor to be truly to utilize modern technology to fill their needs. SR and the like is revolutionary in a sense that people are getting wise to reduce the risk involved, but overall not a revolution to change drug laws, not that is a mission statement or SR..The only way to change laws is from the will of the people in a democratic society, yet as all of us know, even that comes at a price. Why would a dealer want to go legit, only to face the requirements of licensing, regulating, taxing, reporting, inspecting, enforcing yadda yadda yadda...The black market makes it much more simple and effective, you give me money, I give you drugs and both of us hope that we don't get caught. Which leads me to my point. With today's tech that's available at our fingertips, it's almost as if tech has grown into an intricate subculture that greatly reduces the risk of apprehension. Greatly reduced, not eliminated. It's this transition that is conducive to an already paranoid seller and buyer, if everyone is on top of their game, why not take advantage of a fantastic capitalistic market and not worry about becoming legit or legal? I understand progression of eliminating prohibition, not having to worry about LE or prison just because you want to smoke a doob on the weekends grilling up some delicious steak, or for the seller being able to afford their mortgage and put food on the table, but has prohibition prevented these acts from occurring?  No way. When the system doesn't work in our favor, we create a system that does work and it appears that people here are well into a groove when buying or selling, the only factor that can 'piss in our Post Toasties' is getting busted, yet if used effectively, there are tools to circumvent it and reduce that risk.The vast majority here have grown up with the internet, a medium that when used effectively, can be great success and failure. If you're cut out for it, good for you, keep at it and prosper. For people who can't hack it, sorry, leave it to the professionals and hopefully Walmart will sell you some dank on an EBT card...As it stands, if prohibition is something that rustles your jimmies, talk to your congressman, stand up and let your voice heard, vote and make a valid argument. For everyone else, never FE.\n",

That is Law Enforcement can not simply pull the plug and catch the 'bad guys'. To effectively damage a community such as this, more unconventional means are necessary. It is my theory that LEO are actively, right now, as I type this attempting to scare off buyers and vendors. If one takes a hard look at communities in the past, such as TFM, OVDB, and certain private communities, we see that the 'tin foil' hysteria, as you call it is a commonality in all cases. In every case (Barring TFM which never needed to reach 'critical mass') the hysteria has lead to the destruction of the community as a whole. I believe LEO, has grown effective at the use of subversion beyond what most comprehend. They see the hysteria and are actively utilizing it to weaken the community. To some this seems like a 'no shit sherlock' sort of theory, but I think most of us forget at times just how effective LEO is at this sort of stuff.Is it a coincidence that the shit hit the fan DURING and immediately after the 420 sale?

If you finalized early, and your product doesn't arrive, message them politely, but be patient and don't be demanding. Tell them you're going to wait another week, or another 10 days, and you'll get back to them. Make it short and sweet, and give them time to prepare if there's going to need to be a refund or reship. If you're in escrow, politely ask for an extension, or just FE for them and inform them its not there but you trust it'll arrive. Lastly, DON'T SPAM YOUR VENDORS. They don't need daily updates every time you check your empty mailbox.3.Think of this like gambling, never put more in then your willing to lose... protect yourself by researching vendors and boosting your odds of course, but if you ultimately lose your money, due to a scam or simple misfortune, don't fuckin worry about it... you wont starve in the streets, fuckin forget about it and move on... its no thing. this goes with #1 and #2.4.

And yeah that's the best way mate, brush the dirt from your shoulders and call it a life lesson.That's ok mate, no worries. Id really like to be wrong about this too, id love to eat my words here. Can't say im confident about a positive outcome to this situation though. Anyway, like we've said, fuck it move on.\n",

Mods get at me i was one of the first 1500 members here. For full disclosure I am supposedly getting a refund. Will update.  Thats the thing is little vendors wanna buy in bulk from the bigger ups but dont wanna do it through escrow, don't wanna do it in on  a public site and  higher ups and early finalization comes in to play when i have a great rep as a vendor but a shitty rep as a buyer (socks) I get fucked . We need to get this decentralization project up and fucking running.You actaully dire wolf tried 2 full sheets in escrow and had no buyers stats so I cancelled and before you even talked to me you sent me money directly into my account by sending money to another SR user for the two sheets and well guess what.... right after I found out about nomads address. I could post a screen shot of the time you sent 2 sheets worth of coins and the date and than match it as the exact time nomads address got your coins..... literally an hour later... nomad where are his coins, I can post a screen shot of this and of screen shot of your coins reaching a few thousand being right around the hour direwolf sent me money ooe without my permission. all that being said dire put pressure on nomad and DPR to do something and I still, even though I didn't get paid SHIT will send you some of your order, I can screenshot all this as evidence, when you sent coins and than screenshot nomads addy receiving your coins right after that... we could do the math....\n",

I also recommend buying the CD's of these with cash in a shop because who knows who is watching this forumand trying to get a lead on what you might download off torrents or buy online etc. -- Paranoid Pine.Anyway, here's playlist for obtaining a high pine.Tom Waits - \"Going out West\" (Bone Machine album)Juno Reactor - Labyrinth. This is a seriously badass album. Was part of the Matrix. Dirty Sanchez's \"Get it Wet\" and \"Fucking on the Dancefloor\" -- I think it is the Dirty Sanchez, and then the Really Rich Italian Satanists albums. It's completely outrageous music, very addictive and very suitable for working on the darknet. At volume. Yes! Actually that applies to the entire playlist.Nouvelle Vague's \"Guns Of Brixton\" and \"Too Drunk To Fuck\" Massive Attack's \"Angel\"The entire Dark Knight album!Sherlock Holmes (first movie) albumSlumdog Millionaire's \"Mausam And Escape\" and \"Paper Planes\" (MIA I think)Finally I love Parov Stelar's Coco album. Happy music! Such joy! :)--At the moment however, I'm listening to Metallica's \"For Whom the Bell Tolls\" and reading the Communist Manifesto (not a pal of the philosophy clearly, but still the best propaganda in history!) to obtain inspiration in warding off the evils of Privnote and other similarly dreadful nonsense.\n",

It was Adam Smith's belief that when an individual pursues his self-interest, he indirectly promotes the good of society.With the criteria that you require open competition and no coercion between market participants.Many people who mock these ideas today, never really understood them in the first place. They prefer \"sophisticated\" arguments in preference to simple truths. Communism was not an advancement because its theory was more complex, it was really a throwback to older philosophies that go back to the Greeks and no doubt beyond.Only capitalism was an original conception. If people research Maddison's work on economic statistics over the centuries then they will come to similar conclusions: capitalism was the catalyst for where we are today vs the dark ages. Many of our critics forget that even Karl Marx agreed with us on this point. Marx says in the manifesto that we were responsible for the greatest change in history, he saw capitalism as a positive development in comparison to the past, even though he was hyper-critical of it in his day. People also forget that Marx wrote Das Kapital something close to a century before the Revolution began, so they conflate his ideas with a good deal of the rhetoric of the time.In fact, there is a great deal the communists and capitalists agree on, that the general public do not. Which is, I think, interesting.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tI'm cross-posting this from a thread I made about this very thing. Here's my take, as a person that I believe to be both intelligent and like minded to DPR in a way:I originally wrote this post in response to a thread bitching about prices of c certain items, and it ended up being my master thesis on SR as a whole and honestly quite well worded. It's long, but I think that reading it might put the site in to context for those who seem frustrated with a site that has opened Pandora's Box and is nothing we should feel ENTITLED to. When you take out the raw functionality of the site and look at all of the moving pieces, it has to be apparent that there is so much more here going on than you really think about.I normally don't put up walls of text, but - I feel like so many people have the wrong outlook when it comes to this site I had to put down my thoughts. To start off, there are 3 things that I think should be obvious but fly over the heads of lots of people:1. Illegal items have massively varying worth from region to region (MDMA from NL to US, or Adderal from US to UK). This is one of the oldest truths in business, and especially black markets - the farther something illegally made has to travel, the more expensive it's going to be. This is why cocaine (when I did it 6, 7 years ago) was $500 an ounce in the border states but 100 quid a gram in the UK - coke in Europe has come a long way.2. Given that these things are illegal and often not common in many regions of the world (I live in a major metro area in the US and I have not seen a press or MDMA that has shown even a hint of MDMA per Marquis testing for almost 3-4+ years in my city, and it's one of the biggest metro areas in the country. I hear about people who took E, but....it's not E. When (if) they finally try 100mg or so of something from the NL or a press from EU (Defqons), it blows their fucking mind and its value skyrockets. In a nutshell - we now have access to better quality anything and everything, at any time.3. People are always willing to take risk to make money on illegal goods, with the most money being in the rarest items smuggled the longest distance (with few exceptions). The type of people who have this mentality, centered around profit, are often also prone to being selfish, arrogant, and want to argue. To be blunt - we're all not \"the average Joes\" of the world......we're people who somehow stumbled on to an encrypted private international black market with its own currency, laws, and worldwide reach.These three themes have given me the following overall opinion/mindset about SR:Silk Road in itself is a fascinating social experiment if you throw out its functionality as a black market. While the \"message\" or \"goal\" of the site is probably never going to EXACTLY be explained by the makers, it's clear that they wanted to open a Pandora's Box and start something that couldn't ever totally be stopped. While I'm not invited to any of them, I assume by now that there are at least several others site like this, each with the same function (drugs in the mail), but with different mindsets. The only one I know of is Black Market Reloaded, which is flaunting its illegality in its name.  Naming your drug dealing site something that implies it's a site selling drugs isn't too bright IMHO. I'm sure there are plenty of others, all with their own message and \"style/attitude.\" That's great, but it's not Silk Road. Silk Road is the neutral Pandora's Box of the future - now this it exists, it (or it's idea and function) will never go away.TL;DR starts here:My point is this - we're on a massive, semi-anonymous website acting as an international black market for goods and services illegal in nearly every corner of the world. The demographic here is going to be no different than your demographic of any large grouping of people, maybe even black-market specific people. Think of the items for sale here and the \"IRL\" people who normally would have, do have, or could get the drugs and items for sale here. You likely wouldn't like most of them.Throwing SR's absurdly high quality products aside and reliability aside -  I don't think any of us have the luxury of dealing with people half as intelligent, communicative, or interesting as we do here off the Road. SR opens the door to all types on purpose, including bad ones, because everything here builds on the ability to balance the market and improve every aspect of the idea and site.Like every business scene:You'll have your \"in it for the cause\" types who sell amazingly high quality goods at cost or just over types.You'll have your \"squeeze ever dollar out of these fucking customers as I can\" types.You'll have your \"just a regular guy/girl who is just dabbling with buying some things or selling my prescription I don't take\" types - these are the passive, profit-minded (but not greedy) types who aren't \"drug dealers.\"You'll have your scam artists, cons, long cons, and selective scammers. Their bullshit promotes communication amongst the legitimate members of SR.And of course, you'll have your \"total professional, highly reliable, slightly pricey but quality-centric steady-eddies.\" I could name examples, but I'm sure you know who some of them are.If we didn't have all of these types, I would find SR to be a failure in its goal. DPR - feel free to correct me. While the steady-eddie vendors of the Road are the best types for the average buyer (in my opinion), I find it sad to see so much goddamn fighting about shit on the forums of a black market drug dealing website with intelligence levels that SHOULD be higher than the average \"scene.\" Everything that happens here, good and bad, brings balance and stability to the marketplace. It has its swings, it's \"big cons\" like Tony76, but - because of them, better vendors emerge, and more and more people get involved in securing this site, its users, and working to continue what's started here forever. Having too much trust in a place like this was the downfall of the The Farmer's Market, as they weren't they neutral bystander letting everything go down on its own. They had a share the love type message (which isn't bad in itself), but their belief in their non-neutral mindset caused them to make decisions that eventually put them in jail.Maybe you all disagree, but SR was designed to welcome all types, and as a community we have to accept that by having that inherent design, we bring with it all of its pros and cons. DPR and SR are genius in that they're not TRYING to \"spread the love\" or do anything beyond be the functional eBay of the black market that in can't exist anywhere else.By letting us police ourselves, we actually end up with a better community, better communication (even about the bad things and people), and most active and involved users working on their own time to make things safer, better, and more reliable. If all we had was perfect vendors who had perfect packaging, perfect products, and perfect communication, the forums would be just full of garbage posts where people talk about how fucking high they are and yeahhhhhhhhhhhh man SR rules!We need the bad to create the good, and we need the balance created by our completely open scene to constantly keep things at their best. Lots of people don't see it this way, but in the end having overpriced vendors is good, as it leads to undercuts and an efficient, evolving marketplace that caters to its supply and demand. Those who have private needs or separate attitudes quite likely have their own sites or small groups off SR, and that's fine - in fact, that's ideal. Without a central message, SR is the perfectly designed home-base for an all out marketplace with no focus on any one vertical.That's my rant, but - if you're smart enough to be here, do what you need to do, and walk away unharmed - what problem do you have with outliers who have no relation to your specific needs?

      "\t\t\t\tTo answer a couple of points raised.In a libertarian society I will deal with a drunk driver careening in my direction by whipping out my gun and firing a well aimed bullet. Let's hope I'm a good shot. I think it's likely I will be dragging him from his car AFTER he has killed my family member, and executing him by the roadside. However I will then need to deal with his friends and relatives who come looking for vengance. Let's hope my clan is larger and better armed. In fairness this is the model of criminal justice used throughout much of history; this is why men used to carry swords. Some of you seem to regard the right to carry a weapon as a fundamental freedom; I consider a society where I am forced to carry a weapon for self defense as less free.      The idea that in the libertarian society I will be free to choose to live in an enclave where the rules will be of my choosing, and presumably enforced by either the citizens or a private security firm. Also I will drive on roads of my choosing. I'm picturing the road signs: Drunk/reckless route keep left, Safe/Autodrive keep right. Presumably this enclave will have armed guards on the entry's and exits to prevent people with different beliefs about freedom entering.       There is a reason most modern society's have chosen to restrict the use of force to the state and it's agents. Humans are extremely aggressive and in any group there will be a sizable minority who are inclined to settle disputes by violence. Without the authority of the state the rest of us ( who might prefer to remain peaceful) would have no choice but to defend our rights and property violently. I say again that this has been the condition of humanity throughout much of history, and we have always found it useful to defer to authority to avoid violence; whether it be an informal group of tribal elders or a fully fledged nation state.\n",
      "\t\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\tMy thoughts on the remainder of the reading - I will respond to interesting forum posts later.Section 2\"Teacher salaries would probably plummet. No one would have a right to an education guaranteed by the state. The state could ask for and expect no content or results from education at any level.\" (p. 35) I seriously wonder if teacher salaries could fall lower (well, maybe I just don't want to imagine it). Surely in a standards-free libertarian world, teachers would not be required to have a teaching certificate or even a degree, but I do believe that teachers should have education in their subject area and some pedagogical training to be effective, and that training does not come free, especially in a world where K-20 education costs money at every step of the way. \"A huge range of alternatives would exist, but rare among them would be the current system of megaschools that operate as holding tanks for thousands.\" (p. 28-29) I disagree completely with this statement. In private business and industry, the tendency for profitable corporations is naturally to expand in order to serve more customers and create more profit. A purely profit-driven school system would seek to maximize returns on their infrastructure by serving more and more students with the resources the school already possesses. One can already see this in action by observing huge for-profit colleges such as University of Phoenix. Teachers are paid as and treated like nothing more than \"paper graders\", they deliver pre-processed content and evaluate student work using summative evaluations that are simple to grade but do not demonstrate an understanding of the material, only the ability to regurgitate what has been taught. UoP has three times more students enrolled than the next-largest university, despite the questionable quality or value of their educational product. Section 3I have read the arguments already presented on this forum, this is surprisingly a very controversial topic. I would expect SR members to be as angry as I am at the thought of \"[waiting] for the government to administer a test to tell us whether or not we are criminals\" (p. 40) because of the contents of our body. I don't think that the government currently can not prosecute us for simply having drugs in our bloodstream (even when driving), although I understand that is one argument against Washington's upcoming I-502, because it will impose a blood-THC limit for motorists, and that is unfair because one's tolerance to THC can affect your intoxication level (despite a high blood-THC level), and that the testing equipment can be subject to mechanical and user failure. I find it interesting that people who oppose I-502 because of this imposition can still support drunk driving arrests. We know that one's alcohol tolerance can affect the intoxication level, which can also be affected by body size and metabolism. A 120-lb woman who never drinks will be noticeably more intoxicated on the same set of beverages than a 300-lb woman who drinks a pint daily. If I am driving recklessly because I am angry at my spouse or sleep-deprived, is that more OK than driving recklessly because I am drunk? The only difference between the two situations is that driving non-recklessly while drunk is illegal, but driving non-recklessly while angry/sleep-deprived is not. Prosecute me for my actions, not my potential actions. Section 4\"It cannot be, and I predict that if we continue to go down the path, we will replace one bad form of central planning with another. Genuine liberty is not just another form of government management. It means the absence of government management. It is this theme that I would like to pursue further.\" (p. 47) Fascinating, I can't wait to hear his plan to overthrow the world governments (so I can totally disagree and not support the plan, don't worry LEOs!). \"The movement to gated communities has been condemned across the political spectrum but evidently consumers disagree. The market has provided a form of security that the government has failed to provide.\" (p. 52) [tl;dr: I don't know who is more exploitive, government or private industry, but together they seem to perpetuate a cycle of fail. Please forgive the lack of citations below, suburban studies is a pretty small field and I don't want to out myself inadvertently.]I disagree with this sentiment. I have studied the history of American suburbs and interviewed many people about their decision to purchase property that is part of a homeowner's association (or HOA). One common sentiment observed was that of \"All of the homes in desirable neighborhoods or in some suburban areas all of the property available is bound by an HOA.\" It seems as if this is a phenomenon within newer (15 years old or less) subdevelopments and especially prevalent on the east coast, but it is true that in some suburbs and towns it is very difficult to find any property that is not in an HOA. Although the initial drive for HOAs (a lack of code enforcement and in some cases law enforcement from local governments) could be called a failing of government, the tendency for private development companies to always require an HOA feels to me like simply replacing one broken system with another. In markets such as realty (where consumer choice is limited by geographical proximity; you can only fit so many single-family homes in an area) there is little incentive for developers to not use an HOA (some consumers genuinely desire to participate, and they are profitable for the developer), and if every developer requires them then consumers who do not wish to belong to an HOA have few choices (they can move away, but that's quite an undertaking) and can only seek one that is less-restrictive.Some homeowners talked about their \"less-restrictive\" HOA saying things like, \"Some HOAs are crazy and tell you that you can only paint your trim in a pre-approved palette of 6 shades of pastel. Mine only tells homeowners that they can't park cars on the lawn and I'm OK with that, I hate seeing my neighbor park cars on the lawn and it lowers property values of the surrounding homes.\" I truly fail to see the difference, both examples feel to me like other people telling me what is OK to do on my property.People also fail to realize (or think it's paranoid to worry) that the HOA can change the bylaws and rules at any time; today's rules banning cars on lawns could become tomorrow's \"no bicycles on the lawn\". HOAs are also not bound by the First Amendment because they are not the government. It is perfectly within the rights of the HOA to ban only Republican campaign signs from lawns, and most HOAs are able to enforce their rules with sanctions including property seizure, with no recourse for the homeowner. In situations where this happens (they are rare but do occur) I always hear from the internet comment peanut gallery, \"They should have bought a home somewhere else\" or \"They should have sold their home and moved when the rules changed\" or \"They signed the deed, they should have understood this would happen\" but in my view, this is an exploitive (but profitable!) tactic. \"But in what sense has government contributed to it [the web]?\" (p. 55) I don't know, a little thing called ARPANET, and don't forget Al Gore! ;) But seriously, I remember the heated debates over the first spam email, but I felt then and I feel now that neither government nor private companies should seek to restrict internet commerce. \"The same is true for a huge range of activities essential to our civil lives. In education, it is said that the state must impose schooling on all children, else the parents and communities will neglect it. Only the state can make sure that no child is left behind.\" (p. 64) Although I have heard this sentiment expressed to dismiss homeschooling, I would say it's a rare sentiment even from extreme liberals. My argument for a free and appropriate education for every child is not to say that I believe the government knows what's best for children. I am simply opposed to child labor even in the face of extreme poverty, and I have a very hard time defending the right of parents to \"choose\" (it's not much of a choice in places that do not have free education) to send their children to work in the factory. Rockwell (2008) quotes Ludwig von Mises: \"There is an inherent tendency in all governmental power to recognize no restraints on its operation and to extend the sphere of its dominance as much as possible. To control everything, to leave no room for anything to happen of its own accord without the interference of the authorities—this is the goal for which every ruler secretly strives.\" (p. 70) I would argue that you can strike the word \"government\" from that statement. Whether private industry, a monarchy, or a representative democracy, any group of people (or animals, realistically) will seek to increase their sphere of influence. I don't trust either government nor businesses to do what is best for me and mine. \n",

      "Quote from: tootiefruitie on September 30, 2012, 06:13 amThis brings us back to another quote from youQuote from: jameslink2 on September 29, 2012, 10:26 pmSocialisms biggest failing is that it assumes we live in a sort of utopian society, one in which the government would in fact regulate itself, and one in which the government, at it's heart, is good and only looking out for the welfare of others. If, by your own stated belief people are not good at heart and are in fact greedy then what makes you think that people who run the government will be any different? A government is a body of people notably ungoverned. If we look at the context you so wonderfully left out in your description of Social Contract, we can begin to see why a Constitution (which as we know can actually exist as a legal document) is so important, and that it is what governs the \"body of people notably ungoverned.\"So, the first sentence that you quoted from me was a rewording of the original posters comment about libertarianism. Intended to bring to lite the point that what he said of libertarianism could also be said of socialism. If you do not trust humans because of the inherent belief that all people are selfish and greedy then how can you trust them to run a government that is not selfish and greedy. You are basically taking a small number of people and giving them power. Then trusting that they will do the right thing and not what is in there best interest.As to your comment about the constitution nullifying the statement that \"a government is a body of people notably ungoverned\" Tell me, how is that working out. Lets see\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.\"The government has Suspended Habeas corpus, Created \"Free Speach Zones\" to make sure the people who wish to protest are not seen, Initiated Faith based initiatives, and dont even get me started with the whole Wiki leaks crap and it's violations.Ok, so the first amendment is ignored, but they follow the others right?\"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.\"There are lots of gun laws, kind of throws that one out the window as well\"The right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated, and no Warrants shall issue, but upon probable cause, supported by Oath or affirmation, and particularly describing the place to be searched, and the persons or things to be seized.\"Unless you are in an airport or near (Within 200 miles of) a border, then they do what ever they want.\"No person shall be held to answer for a capital, or otherwise infamous crime, unless on a presentment or indictment of a Grand Jury, except in cases arising in the land or naval forces, or in the Militia, when in actual service in time of War or public danger; nor shall any person be subject for the same offense to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb; nor shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself, nor be deprived of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation.\"and\"In all criminal prosecutions, the accused shall enjoy the right to a speedy and public trial, by an impartial jury of the State and district wherein the crime shall have been committed, which district shall have been previously ascertained by law, and to be informed of the nature and cause of the accusation; to be confronted with the witnesses against him; to have compulsory process for obtaining witnesses in his favor, and to have the Assistance of Counsel for his defence.\"Do I even need to point out Guantanamo bay or the guy that leaked stuff to Wiki Leaks? I could go on but I think I have made the point. Although they should be governed by the constution they are not thus they are \"notably ungoverned\"QuoteAlso remember that we're trying to create an efficient society. Look no further than socialist governments if you want an example of efficiency. In countries where health care is nationalized, they're able to run it at half the cost of the USA.Looking at the 4 remaining socialist governments seems to contradict your statement. I believe that if the US had a true free market healthcare system we would see huge drops in the cost of healthcare. As it stands the AMA controls the healthcare system. They have pushed state and federal laws that require doctors to complete their training in AMA approved schools and then artificially restrict the size of the classes to control the numbers of doctors on the market. It is more difficult to become a Medical General practitioner that it is to become a veterinarian. Yet a veterinarian has to be trained in multiple species as well as humans. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\tThe second amendment is a really tricky case. Kind of like the oft-ignored third amendment, the second amendment has to be looked at in the context of history. First of all, it does say that it is to establish a \"well regulated militia.\" So well regulated is right there in the text, and that can be interpreted a number of ways. Plus back when it was written, the guns were one-shot muskets that had to be reloaded for a fairly long period of time before being fired again. The Constitution is a living document, meaning we can change interpretations of it over time. As it is the government does in fact have the ability to infringe on a right guaranteed by the Constitution, as long as they can convince the Supreme Court that their is a just case for doing so. For example, the first amendment right of free speech does not apply to someone who calls their business rival and says \"I'm going to come over to your house and kill you tonight!\" Nor does it apply to someone who yells \"FIRE!\" in a crowded movie theater. Likewise, you can have restrictive guns laws in place IF you can determine that their is a just cause for doing so. I'm not here to argue over how restrictive gun laws should be or whatever, but it's a pointless argument to make on your end either way. Even showing cases where the government does badly does nothing to help your position that the free market would do it better. Of course the government makes mistakes. No one claims it's perfect. But you likewise cannot claim that the free market is perfect. Some things would be better, sure. Drugs would be legalized and that sort of thing, But the number of detriments would far surpass the number of benefits. I want you to imagine a world where there are corporate regulatory laws in effect. What would stop child labor from being used again? Or terrible wages for long working hours? The big flaw of libertarianism, and partly with capitalism in general, is that it allows the rich and powerful to control everything. The top 10% have more power than the bottom 90%. Without government interference, what change does the bottom have against the top? You can look at social mobility statistics to see how unlikely it is for someone at the bottom to ever rise to the top. In America, around 66% of people born into the bottom 20% income level ever make it past the bottom 40% income level. Similarly, 66% of those born into the top 20% of income stay within the top 40%. I don't have any particular problems with the second statistic, since I never think success needs to be discouraged. But that first statistic is disheartening. In what free market system are those bottom feeders able to get out? It's hard enough as it is. Again, you can look at countries who have more socialist policies to see the difference, and it's outstanding. America ranks near the bottom of countries with high social mobility. It's great at letting the rich get richer, but it's terrible at letting the poor break free. This really shouldn't be that surprising to anyone who has been poor in their lives. There are a number of disadvantages that you now have to face from birth. Everyone knows that it takes money to make money. Well in a libertarian society, the only people that have money are the ones born with it. Libertarians love to praise the great economic climbers like Andrew Carnegie or Richard Nixon. Yet people like that are the exception, not the norm. The norm is that you live and die in the class you were born into. Government regulation can help that. Getting out of poverty is tough, but it can be done if the economic and social programs are there. But the free market isn't going to provide those. Only the government can, because the government is about helping people achieve a certain standard of living. The free market is about making as much profit as possible, the people be damned. It's also terribly inefficient for the consumers, laborers, and many conveniences like roads, where one unified body controlling them is just easier. This is the importance of government in society. On social issues, I totally agree with libertarians. Let people put what they want in their bodies, let people have their privacy, allow people to act as they wish if it doesn't harm anyone else. But unfortunately, being rich without paying back into the system that made you rich is somewhat indirectly harming others. This is where the social contract is important. You entered society, you played by its rules, you used its programs, and you got to the top. Well the next people that want to play by its rules, they need those programs too, and you now have the obligation to pay back in. Ultimately libertarianism is going to remain an unpopular ideology because civilizations going back thousands of years have understood the importance of government. Libertarians are trying to fight for a philosophy that was disregarded long, long ago.\n",

But I would have no reason to sign such a contract. Additionally, in return for their slavery the example person would receive a higher quality of life. Why would someone voluntarily sell themselves into slavery unless they get a large benefit out of it? So really it is hardly even slavery.

We are treating people like commodities now, like a chicken or a cow. That's what slavery is, or it is not slavery of any kind that is recognizable to me.

Indentured labor is different because there is a time limit after which you are a freeman/freewoman.

Why?Because the child did not enter into a contract with you. Even in a libertarian society, only free agents who are capable of rational thought are capable of entering into a contact, as no coercive contracts are considered binding. For this same reason it is not a legitimate contact if you hold a gun to someones head while they sign themselves into slavery. As a child is not a rational being it can not legitimately enter into a contract of self slavery with you. QuoteA child would be a drain on resources until it's old enough to be put to productive use, so unless it is also a slave I'd just kill it.I am not sure how that would be dealt with. Clearly a child is incapable of entering into a legitimate contract, so it can not be born into slavery. However you are not required to care for the child of your slave if this is not part of the original contract signed by the slave. This would result in the child dying of malnutrition eventually if you forbid the slave from caring for it. Some anarchists believe that children are the property of their parents until they are old enough to make a claim to their own independence, following this line of thought you would legitimately be able to kill the baby as it would be the property of your slave. I disagree with this though, I think that children own themselves as much as adults do, but as they can not fend for themselves it brings up some interesting problems. I do not believe that you have the right to kill your slaves baby, but perhaps you do have the right to order your slave to not care for its child. Certainly you do not own the baby as a slave. I suppose I would hope that some charitable defense agency would act on behalf of such babies by taking them from you and raising them to adulthood, in the hopes that the adult will pay them back for saving its life. As the baby is not owned by you and also not owned by its parent, I believe it would be acceptable for a third party to take parental control of the child, especially as that would be in the best interests of such a child and indeed is what one would likely imagine the child would choose if it had the ability for rational thought. QuoteWe are treating people like commodities now, like a chicken or a cow. That's what slavery is, or it is not slavery of any kind that is recognizable to me.

In fact historically speaking what I'm describing, how children were either born into chains or disposed of, did occur.You can own the product of your slaves labor, but that does not include its children. Your freedom ends where another persons begins. You are free to contract people into slavery and people are free to contract themselves into slavery, however one person can not contract another person into slavery. Thus a parent can not contract its child into slavery anymore than I can contract you into slavery. QuoteYes, enslaving the children is cruel almost beyond imagining, but the point I'm making is sound. When you have ownership of any domestic animal, you own it's products, like meat, eggs, butter, and so forth. The same principal must apply to people too. People and livestock are different.

You own a cow for its milk. You own a chicken for its eggs. You own a stock for its dividends. There is no point in ownership if you don't get to own the production. As you do not own the child, putting it down would be murder imo. I certainly would not object to a defense agency assassinating you anyway. Not caring for the child would be more acceptable, even though that would certainly result in its death. I believe that you could rightfully force the slave to abort the fetus if it has not developed substantially. However, after the child is born you can either care for it or ignore it. Better yet, some agency could offer to pay you in order to enter onto your property long enough to remove the child (as you do not own the child you can not strictly speaking sell it to them, but you could sell the right to obtaining the child from your land).  QuoteI am not certain. But I only require a small number of 'stock' in order to accumulate more via sexual reproduction. The humans are treated like cattle, made to constantly produce children which are then forced to work for myself at the first possibility. So I don't need very many people to accomplish my evil plan. Like you say, I could import some desperately poor souls from the Third World.Except that assumes that you own your slaves children and I would disagree with this so the point is moot. The most you could do is deny care to the child and let it die of dehydration. QuoteYou yourself may never sign yourself over to my ownership. Most people wouldn't. And that's the kicker.

At that point it will be moral for defense agencies to storm your property and release your prisoners, as well as to hold you to some form of justice for false imprisonment. If you do not raise the children up, they will die very quickly after they are born. So you can not force your slaves to produce massive armies for you. QuoteThat is not what slavery means kmfkewm!

      "Quote from: jameslink2 on October 02, 2012, 12:19 pmPine, I think this cuts directly to the heart of the assignment and discussion of a true free market as well as the governments view of a person.Slavery is defined as \"The state of one bound in servitude as the property of a slaveholder or household.\" (http://www.thefreedictionary.com/slavery)So the question is Who owns the people? In a free market we are sovereign and are owned by no one unless we sell ourselves. Most governments believe they own the people and are thus entitled to a percentage of the work a person does (Income Tax), the right to take property away from that person, and the right to tell that person how they can live there lives. Well governments do use coercion all the time but we were talking about how voluntary transactions of this sort can lead to coercion.QuoteIf we can not sell ourselves then we have no sovereignty and must acknowledge that we are already owned and our life is not our own.No. Selling yourself (according to pine) is a null right. It cannot exist in a free market. You and kmfkewm assume that because I prevent you using that right, that I then take that right from you. This doesn't make sense to me because I am not availing of that right in any way. Rights are not physical units like commodities, they are activities or actions. So if your rights are not used, then they for all intents and purposes are non existent. You have no right. But neither do I. Nobody has it, it's just gone. Nullified.Property on the other hand, *is* transferable. If you are a programmer, you could think of Property as an 'Object' and rights as a 'Method'. I can control your rights if I own you. If I do this then kmfkewm and jameslink are correct to say I have taken your rights. But if my action of preventing you exercising your right to sell yourself into slavery is the case then I don't own you, it's a logical contradiction to say pine owns you when pine has explicitly made it impossible for anybody to own you except yourself.Quote from: kmfkewm on October 02, 2012, 12:20 pm2. (Business / Industrial Relations & HR Terms) a person who is forced to work for another against his willI believe that most people use definition 2 from the second block of definitions. At least I have always thought of slavery as being involuntary servitude.Yes, that is what slavery is. Owning somebody == involuntary servitude, they are the exact same thing. That's why selling yourself into slavery isn't a legitimate voluntary transaction. The transaction itself is voluntary, yes. Everything that follows is completely coercive since you aren't a free agent. Even if you agreed with every single thing your owner told you to do and think, you still aren't a free agent because there were no choices.The institution of slavery does not recognize humans a special category. The idea of some benevolent agency to look after the children of slaves or some slave union to send hit squads after evil pine just cannot happen because there is no reason for those institutions to exist. Those operations are in fact illegal when slavery is an institution. The benevolent agency has kidnapped my labor and the assassination attempt would have police attempting to foil it because everything evil pine is doing is completely legal.Anyway, I said I'd stop, so this time I shall really stop! :D\n",

You cannot include your future offspring in the deal as children are not property.Enslaving by force I would have thought is not permitted even by the most extravagant libertarian.       I have continued reading this book ( skipping over his constant crude mischaracterisations of socialism) with interest. I must admit to difficulty in understanding why the author is so idealogically committed to the market as the absolute and only judge of human endevour. To me, the market is a natural force; an extremely complex system of counterbalancing forces that has a tendency to self regulate. But to claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.     An analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.        The market was made for man. It should not be master.        Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\". But we are not talking about teenagers earning spending money here. Child labour regulations were brought in after the industrial revolution, when unbridled capitalism amongst the factories and mills of northern England had driven wages for the \"hands\" below subsistence level. The children of these working families \"wanted\" the \"freedom\" to work, as the alternative was hunger. This to me seems a poor kind of freedom.          You all seem to agree that to force a child to work against his will was wrong. But what if the economic system you have established leaves a child with this kind of choice? Where is the freedom for this child? Work or starve?        Sadly there are many children in the world today faced with this choice. But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.         I feel about the market a similar way that I feel about government: when it ceases to serve our purpose we may freely discard it in favor of a better system.         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations. In many industries there are 3-4 main  players offering roughly the same range of products for the same price, and this tends to lessen the benefits of competition for the consumer. And even when the customer benefits, the suppliers don't.       Large companies suffer many of the same faults as large governments: a tendency to seek nothing but a continuation of their own power. We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force. With all due respect, that's kind of the problem with private police forces! I have difficulty seeing how such a system could work peacefully to resolve disputes.       If I assault my neighbor, who's police force deals with the complaint? His or mine? Or do we both have the same one, being neighbors.       If I am paying a private force, do they take my side automatically. Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.       Some good points ghost, and thanks for not taking offense when the author criticizes your views.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amAn analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other.

It should not be master.As described in section 2 of the reading, the market is not yet another policy prescription enforced by government, it is the absence of such force.  It is the absence of one party imposing their view of good and bad on another.  So, the market is not made, it emerges from the multitude of voluntary interactions between individuals.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\".

But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.I'm not sure how we disagree here.  If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option?  If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse.  That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves.  Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities.Had they been allowed to develop freely, only under the constrains of supply, demand and property rights, they would have had to provide a safe work environment for their employees, if that's what the employees wanted.  Let me give you a quick example.  Nike and Reebok both have shoe factories in the same city.  All of their resources and external conditions are effectively identical.  The only thing they can vary is the quality of the work environment for their employees.  Nike chooses to spend $1 per man-hour maintaining an improved work environment for its employees, while Reebok keeps that dollar as profit.  Reebok will quickly find itself unable to attract the employee base it needs to produce its shoes as Nike takes its employees and market share.  So, Reebok, instead of improving the work conditions, simply passes the extra $1 per hour on to their employees.  Now we are seeing the market at work.  Employees are now faced with the option of a safe work environment, or an extra dollar per hour.  Some will choose safety while others will choose the extra pay.And this is exactly what has happened eventually, where now employers do all they can to attract good employees away from their competitors.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations.

My views have been forged by a search for the truth that has lasted my entire adult life and continues to this day.  I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors.  Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward.  Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs?  We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tSeems like I'm a little late for the drunk driving debate, but figure I'll throw in my two cents.I'm very much libertarian, but there is a perfectly valid (and freedom friendly) logical reason why drunk driving should be illegal.Complex systems that require formalized rules to ensure efficiency/safety are established in several areas of our lives. Most of these involve some form of certification or license. While I don't believe it should be illegal to \"practice law\" without having passed the bar, not anyone should be allowed to claim to be a professional lawyer. Practicing medicine shouldn't be illegal without having gone to med school and obtained a license to practice medicine, but it should be illegal to claim to be a Doctor of Medicine without it. Or a Registered Nurse, etc.Public areas designated for automobile transportation (the roadways) likewise have regulations to ensure safety/efficiency. One must obtain proper training, and prove the training to operate a motor vehicle on public road ways. If you want to drive drunk anywhere else, I'll agree that it should be legal. However to say it should be legal to drive drunk on public roadways, is the same (to me) as saying it should be legal to practice law or medicine in a negligent manner without repercussions. Technically it may be, but you will lose your license to do so and may suffer heavy fines and possibly even jail time in the case of a negligent homicide due to medical malpractice. Not much different than driving already, except in medical/legal it's kept pretty exclusively to civil rather than criminal courts.Perhaps that should be the change. Legalization of driving drunk, but penalties still remain, albeit in civil proceedings rather than criminal. Without the law enforcement element, I'd hazard to guess insurance companies would be pressured by market forces to require automobiles have alcohol sensors and constitute some contractual agreement by their use that you will be the one driving the vehicle until someone else uses the sensor. Blowing for someone else would be a violation of the contract, subjecting yourself to full liability of whatever actions the driver takes.Interesting thought experiment, a world where drunk driving is legal. However there would still need to be some form of regulation, and it would just fall upon the corporations that take liability and the administrative bodies that regulate in a similar manner as other industries do.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tHello again, I'm a little disappointed the debate hasn't moved on in my absence. Mostly because it means I have to try and answer your convincing arguments!       Firstly, the charge of willful ignorance:  I was referring more generally to the libertarian position; it was not intended as a personal attack. I think I was just carried away with my own rhetoric. What I was trying to say though is, it's one thing to offer a picture of how the economics of a particular situation might play out; it's important also to consider ways in which the reality might differ from the theory. Like the scientific method; a theory must be strongly tested before it is accepted. More of this later.          Similarly, in my eagerness to paraphrase Jesus I may have chosen my words poorly! I agree that the market is not an imposed system, but is what happens in the absence of any interference. This is what I was meaning to convey by describing the market as a force of nature.          Again, I agree that the analogy of the human body is not perfect. I think it was Carl Sagan who pointed out that, while the ability to see analogies is a vital part of human creativity, to see analogies in everything is a symptom of mania.           Perhaps a better comparison is with natural selection. (I assume that you accept evolution; if not please let me know now so I don't waste any more time!) Evolution by natural selection is working on all living things constantly. It allows what is inefficient to die out while allowing the efficient to predominate. If we allowed evolution to take its course among humans, many common genetic diseases and infirmities would be less common. Many humans would not reach breeding age without medical intervention. However it would be monstrous to suggest that we allow nature to take its course in these situations. Eugenics and social Darwinism are dirty words these days.          Evolution is also blind, and limited in its abilities. It cant \" see the bigger picture\" but can only work within the constraints of the immediate situation. For example, the recurrent pharyngeal nerve in mammals runs from the neck down into the chest cavity and back up to the cheek. In giraffes this is an unnecessary diversion of twenty feet or so. In our fish ancestors this route was a straight line, but as evolution took place the relative position of skeletal parts etc has changed. Similarly the upright posture of humans, having been developed from our quadruped ancestors, causes severe back problems and other difficulties.          In both these cases evolution cannot \"step back\" and offer a better design; natural selection can only act contingently, in response to the circumstances. Similarly the market can only react to the conditions it finds. For instance; in the case of our hypothetical starving children. The market has offered them the choice between work and starvation ( the market having set their parents wages below subsistence level.) As far as the market is concerned those are the two choices. It cannot step back and say 'well obviously children needing to earn to survive instead of going to school is unacceptable' (no doubt the markets children are attending a good fee paying school!)          It's not clear to me that the market will automatically act to raise the wages of the shoe factory workers to the point where their children can afford to attend school instead of working. In the world today, and during the industrial revolution, low wages for factory workers are due to the supply of labour exceeding demand. A major cause of this is overpopulation. Poor people in countries that lack a welfare safety net are often inclined to regard offspring as a kind of pension, to care for them in old age.          Where supply of labour is greater than demand, the competition for workers you describe does not take place. Instead wages are pushed down. It might be argued that the low wages will encourage other companies to open factories in the area, until eventually supply=demand, and wages begin to rise. But this is not the only factor. Cost of raw materials, transport etc also affect the situation. It's not obvious that the balance point when reached will be favorable to the workers. It's more likely that the factory building will cease BEFORE the supply and demand of labour has equalized. ( think about the incentives as the balance approaches and wages begin to rise)          In the real world shoe factories in India and china, and in the cotton mills of industrial 18th century England, child labour persisted for generations. The market showed/shows little inclination to improve conditions.          In fact, improved working conditions in the real world are strongly correlated with strong labour unions, good regulations, a welfare state and minimum wage ( contrary to the predictions of industry, introducing minimum wages doesn't seem to cause an increase in unemployment). Look at the difference between the US and the UK. Historically the UK has had a stronger welfare system, and more active trade unions. Workers in the UK get a statutory 6 weeks paid holiday every year, compared to 2 weeks in the US. Our American cousins are expected to work harder for longer hours for less pay.            When I reached the chapter on the environment, it seems the author is attacking a straw man. Eco sentimentalism and the naturalistic fallacy are of course ridiculous. However our planet does have some problems and I am not convinced that the market is the best custodian of our dwindling resources. Take oil:         I used to cherish the fond belief that, as oil stocks ran low and the price of oil rose, the market would cause alternative sources of energy such as nuclear and renewables to take over ( as they became cheaper than oil) What seems to be happening instead is that, as the price of oil rises, it becomes more viable to extract oil from less concentrated sources such as oil shales and sands. Unfortunately these sources are much more polluting ( again, there is no market mechanism to prevent pollution. The consumer gets the benefit of the oil, but the pollution cost is shared by everyone, hence no incentive not to pollute) The rising oil price seems to be incentivizing a ever more frantic scramble for the remaining reserves. This is another illustration of the markets inability to take a long term view. It can only respond to the immediate situation.           It seems to me that the market will not stop until oil is too expensive to be useful.   Of course as the price increases there will be an incentive to develop alternatives, but what damage will be done to the environment in the meantime. I am not being sentimental about nature. If the global temperature rises by a few degrees and the sea level rises, many highly populated areas will become uninhabitable. If agricultural land migrates north and south, ( and chinas good rice growing land ends up in Russia), the market will make adjustments, but the adjustment process will be traumatic.          Anyway, I don't want you to think I am close minded to these ideas. I think the author takes something of an extremist stance, but he makes many interesting points.Certainly the market is the only game in town. Regardless of what I might think, it is going to remain the dominant force in human society. I have no problem with this, I just think we need some other authority to mitigate problems the market may create. This doesn't necessarily have to be leviathan like government. I noted with interest that the author seems to have a quiet admiration for feudalism. The concept of a society governed by competing authorities is an interesting one.        Clearly, any movement to change society for the better is going to need to prove itself through competition. It cannot be imposed from above. For a while now, I have been thinking about the idea of worker owned companies. I would be interested to hear critiques of the following:           The standard model for a business is employees under a hierarchy of managers, who take care of the day to day running of the company. The company is owned by the shareholders, who appoint a board of directors. The two sides of the business are seperate. The responsibility of the directors is to maximize profits for the shareholders. Usually the interest of the shareholders coincide with the employees but not always.          Now consider the case of a company where the employees own all the shares. It will work just the same way, they can employ directors etc. BUT such a company will not need to show a profit. It will only need to break even. As long as it makes enough to cover all costs and pay everyones wages, it can continue to trade. Freed from the pressure to make profit, surely such a company could undercut its competitors, while paying its suppliers and employees better. Would a business arranged along these lines come to dominate its sector?        Since this doesnt seem to be happening, perhaps I have missed something. I would be interested in people's thoughts on this.\n",

Similarly the market can only react to the conditions it finds. The problem with that view of the market is the following.Yes, markets have evolutionary characteristics, beyond question. But... the kinds of inefficiencies you are describing remain unsolved in evolution because a 'just suits' solution exists. It's not optimal, but it works.In markets however, the suboptimal design of your \"giraffe\" can be arbitraged into a better giraffe. In a market, something that \"works\" doesn't' mean a company has a guaranteed place on the food chain. My point is that if you can see an inefficiency, then there is the possibility of a corporation to exploit that inefficiency. Market evolution is not blind. That is a misconception. It is filled with agents (millions of intelligent designers if you will, coordinated by the price system) searching for inefficiencies. You are one of those agents my friend. When you obtain milk from the shop, you try to choose perhaps the milk you feel is superior, or the cheapest milk, but you don't choose mediocre milk for a higher price when there is an alternative. The exact same algorithm applies to each level of capitalism, whether it's consumers, workers, employers or investors.The inefficiencies in markets, which do exist, come from either the things that nobody thought of, or else they come from things we have thought of, but which we can't do anything about e.g. it is impossible to build a nuclear power station, even though demand exists for cheap electric, for political reasons because certain regulations create a bar too high to leap over for market participants.Side Note: the bust and boom cycle of the stock market is not representative of the overall market economy, this is a widespread idea, as widespread as it is fallacious. Bust and boom cycles are largely mass psychology at work. They do not reflect underlying businesses in the short term. At all. The stock market represents something like 1% - 5% of all the capital in capitalism at the most, and is therefore just one part of the picture. When the stock market declines by 50%, it is not as if half the companies literally go bust, otherwise the unemployment rate would be instantly around 75% or more. What I'm trying to say is that a lot of this railing against the market is based on a misconception of the relationship between the market and corporations, in the short term it doesn't make a jot of difference to a corporation if it's share price declines by 50%. People forget (I'm being too nice, they are merely ignorant of the facts) that the stock market is a secondary market, that corporations raise capital from investment banks and not the stock market directly where share trading takes place. A low P/E ratio will make it difficult for a corporation to borrow capital (because the bank will believe they are less likely to repay the debt as they have lower profits), but we're talking about a process that takes years and years to culminate, not weeks or months.QuoteFor instance; in the case of our hypothetical starving children. The market has offered them the choice between work and starvation ( the market having set their parents wages below subsistence level.) As far as the market is concerned those are the two choices. It cannot step back and say 'well obviously children needing to earn to survive instead of going to school is unacceptable' (no doubt the markets children are attending a good fee paying school!)Wages cannot be below subsistence level, that's economically impossible. You are also discounting something important here. If the children cannot go to school in the market, that is because there is no resources available for such a thing.You cannot just wish schools out of thin air. The resources for teachers, equipment and organization has to come from somewhere. If those resources don't physically exist, then it is because the market is not yet powerful enough to provide them. But when it is powerful enough, they spontaneously appear. If you are using the government as a tool to enable some poor kids to get to school instead of coal mining or something, then you may think you're doing a great and noble thing. But actually you are just slowing down progress, you've created a tiny island of progress in the midst of an ocean of less advantaged souls that didn't have your eye pass over them. In fact, in a great irony, you are generating inequality.This would be very difficult to see, because although perhaps you've changed the lives of a several hundred pupils, you've taken away a pencil and paper away from hundreds of thousands.I'm not even saying it's as simple as this. I am saying this is where you have to start from. There is a fixed amount of energy to play with, and unless you generate more energy somehow through greater efficiency, then you are just in the business of reallocation. Things change, but the net result is at best identical to what would have happened had you done nothing at all.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 am          It's not clear to me that the market will automatically act to raise the wages of the shoe factory workers to the point where their children can afford to attend school instead of working. In the world today, and during the industrial revolution, low wages for factory workers are due to the supply of labour exceeding demand. Blake's 'satanic mills'. Always wheeled out. HG, there was immense demand for work and workers in England during the industrial revolution. Wages were higher in the factories than on the land. If they were not then it wouldn't have worked. I can quote you Adam Smith, where he explains how workers were migrating from A to B because wages were three or four times higher. There was enormous disparities between regions in England in fact, which was arbitraged by migrant labor, canals and shipping.In practice your idea of 'eternal factory labor' is incorrect. I suggest you watch a short film on this exact subject by Johan Norberg called \"Globalization is Good\", because it is difficult to put into words why, but it is so. Things do get better for the poor under capitalism. When the market is being allowed to be productive it is a rising tide that lifts all boats.What you are doing, is creating normative metrics. You believe a wage is too low, or lower than it should be, but you have not explained why you believe this. This is the great sin of socialism. They come up with completely arbitrary ideas about what prices should be, but without any explanation of why it is $3.76 and not $3.77. Just because you believe people deserve better, does not mean anything substantive. I mean, are you willing to be wrong about this?To put it another way. Unless you can help everybody, unless your ideas for raising wages for shoe factor workers affect all the workers, then they are unsustainable at best and even create poverty at worst. You see what you see, but you don't see what you don't see. Let's say we double the price of labor for all shoe factory laborers. Now shoes are twice as expensive.You have advantaged one class of people, over everybody else. No more capital was generated by your generosity.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 amA major cause of this is overpopulation.

It's more likely that the factory building will cease BEFORE the supply and demand of labour has equalized. ( think about the incentives as the balance approaches and wages begin to rise)          In the real world shoe factories in India and china, and in the cotton mills of industrial 18th century England, child labour persisted for generations. The market showed/shows little inclination to improve conditions.HG, the only important thing is that more capital is created. And in practice wages increase, as they have always done in capitalist economies. Seriously! There is no 'balance point' such as that to which you're referring, this is a too simple abstraction. Look at the cotton mills during the Industrial Revolution. It's not as if all that cotton was for the upper classes or something, it was for the same people working in the factories and on the land.The idea the market \"shows no inclination to improve conditions\" is so completely wrong I don't know where to begin. In that time period you're referring to, people began to live 5, 10, 15 years longer on average than previously! In that time period you're referring to, England and Holland were the first countries to become developed, to escape the Malthusian Trap of endless famines once and for all. Less starvation, less disease because of the cotton clothing vs woolen clothing (disease carrying pests don't like cotton, it wasn't just about having extra clothes or something).See here! https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jbkSRLYSojoThings changed in the 18th century.

      "\t\t\t\tPart 2 of a 2 Part Pine WOT Series!Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 am    In fact, improved working conditions in the real world are strongly correlated with strong labour unions, good regulations, a welfare state and minimum wage ( contrary to the predictions of industry, introducing minimum wages doesn't seem to cause an increase in unemployment). Look at the difference between the US and the UK. Historically the UK has had a stronger welfare system, and more active trade unions. Workers in the UK get a statutory 6 weeks paid holiday every year, compared to 2 weeks in the US. Our American cousins are expected to work harder for longer hours for less pay.Here I nearly rage-quit, but I continue! 1. Workers in the UK don't actually get paid as well as their American counterparts. Median household income (the \"big picture\" as opposed to straight wages since that wouldn't factor in people not working directly) was 25k (UK) and 31k (USA).  Source: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Median_household_income2. It is true that the US has shorter holiday time on average (five days according to one chart), but then again the unemployment in the US is lower and taxes are considerably lower, partly because there is no VAT tax but also more generally. The result is that purchasing power parity is such that a US citizen living in the UK would have to spend 34% more in order to attain a comparable standard of living. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purchasing_power_parity#OECD_comparative_price_levelsSo don't start feeling sorry for us just yet, thanks.--I'm not going to discuss trade unions and whatnot, because it's a whole other discussion, but on the issue of the min wage, you manage to make pine scowl. The majority of economists, for a long time now, have agreed that the minimum wage, if made higher, increases unemployment. There are technicalities and caveats to go along with that assessment of course, but that's the general picture.I mean, this is so widely accepted among economists that it's not even a left/right thing. Depending on what survey you're looking at, 50% - 90% of economists agree with this. It's only a big controversy politically, not economically.The minimum wage is a horrible horrible idea.I much prefer the idea of a basic income, (as was Hayek and Friedman). A basic income is where everybody receives, non income assessed (you can of course hand it back if you don't want it) quantity of money per citizen, sufficient to feed, clothe etc. The quantity of tax necessary to make that work is absolutely tiny, but the social advantage is clear and it prevents disruption to the labor market. This is contrary to the insanity that is your UK welfare system, where if you add up all the income taxes and subtract all the welfare entitlements paid out, you generate a negative number. :oIt is not that the welfare apparatus is especially benevolent to UK citizens either. It is that the entire thing is so hugely expensive that it swallows up more capital than it processes. You have the most inefficient model of welfare in the world. Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 am            When I reached the chapter on the environment, it seems the author is attacking a straw man. Eco sentimentalism and the naturalistic fallacy are of course ridiculous. However our planet does have some problems and I am not convinced that the market is the best custodian of our dwindling resources. Take oil:         I used to cherish the fond belief that, as oil stocks ran low and the price of oil rose, the market would cause alternative sources of energy such as nuclear and renewables to take over ( as they became cheaper than oil) What seems to be happening instead is that, as the price of oil rises, it becomes more viable to extract oil from less concentrated sources such as oil shales and sands. Unfortunately these sources are much more polluting ( again, there is no market mechanism to prevent pollution. The consumer gets the benefit of the oil, but the pollution cost is shared by everyone, hence no incentive not to pollute) The rising oil price seems to be incentivizing a ever more frantic scramble for the remaining reserves. This is another illustration of the markets inability to take a long term view. It can only respond to the immediate situation.The central reason why nuclear didn't develop in the last half century or so is solely down to politics. I don't think there's even a nuclear facility built in the US for 35 years because of it, it is such a political hot potato. Anyway, the problem I have with your idea here, is that you believe renewable energy is the solution. Don't get me wrong! I love the idea of having an energy independent system, I mean it fits in perfectly with my libertarian ideas. The problem is that it is expensive, really really expensive. Like if we try really really hard in the US to make renewables work, then it'll still only be 5% of our entire energy requirements in a few decades.I mean never mind oil for a second. A huge number of the power we use is from coal, still! I believe that the market is looking for a solution, and that one of those solutions is probably going to be scale gas. That is a big improvement on both oil and coal. It can be used for transport, it is cheaper than oil/gas to power stations. There is more of it around. It has less carbon footprint widget thing that I don't particularly care about, but still, it's a perk.And you know what? People are turning out in droves to prevent scale gas being extracted because of a stupid pseudoscientific documentary called Gasland, which is a beautiful piece of propaganda, but has absolutely no truth in it. Literally the entire movie is a lie. It is very compelling though, which is easy when you're fast and free with the facts instead of actually explaining the entire story, and let us be frank, just making shit up.I'm not ranting at you here, it is just that once again, we have the market vs political populism. I don't think the market is the primary cause of this short sightedness you believe you're seeing.Secondly, apart from politics causing problems, you have to recognize that coal and oil, dirty they may be, are powerful and cheap sources of energy. Price is important. To put my point in the words of the Big Lebowski \"Well, like, that's just your opinion man\". Plenty of people agree with you (and I) that going to other energy solutions is important for various reasons. But... That's just our opinion. It doesn't negate that lots more people may not be able to afford our opinions in practice, however wonderful they may be. tldr; what you're calling \"The Long View\" that you're saying the market doesn't take and should take, could merely be completely wrong. Maybe we'll be using methane hydrates as a form of fuel instead in 50 years, since there's about a trillion times more of that than all the oil, gas, coal and every other form of non-renewable energy put together. There are other options, maybe we don't see them yet.Maybe... just maybe... this is not a giant big emergency that you think it is.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 am           It seems to me that the market will not stop until oil is too expensive to be useful.   Of course as the price increases there will be an incentive to develop alternatives, but what damage will be done to the environment in the meantime. I am not being sentimental about nature. If the global temperature rises by a few degrees and the sea level rises, many highly populated areas will become uninhabitable. If agricultural land migrates north and south, ( and chinas good rice growing land ends up in Russia), the market will make adjustments, but the adjustment process will be traumatic.Yeah... I don't believe that's going to happen at all. Do you remember \"The Population Bomb\" by Ehrlich? Every so often a popular idea takes over everything for a while with claims of catastrophe. In practice such people almost always turn out to be wrong. I have actually talked to a number of climate scientists about this, involved in a famous project that shall go unnamed here. I won't go into it here, but let's just say that \"their\" ideas are not the \"public's ideas\" about climate change. I mean these are real live scientists working in this field, and they are pretty far away from \"and then the world became uninhabitable and we swam with the polar bear\" vision that the media are running with. Climate change, yes, most likely. Catastrophe, not by a long shot, such claims are incredibly, incredibly speculative.I think the reason that I don't take the \"we got to save the world\" people seriously is because literally 9/10s of the people I've met with that frame of mind are not scientists, and not only are they not scientists, but when I question them, I find out they believe that if the North Pole melted completely that the sea levels would rise. (!)At that point I just stop taking anything else they say seriously. These people are scientifically illiterate about the most elementary aspects of the subject.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 am          Anyway, I don't want you to think I am close minded to these ideas. I think the author takes something of an extremist stance, but he makes many interesting points.Certainly the market is the only game in town. Regardless of what I might think, it is going to remain the dominant force in human society. I have no problem with this, I just think we need some other authority to mitigate problems the market may create. This doesn't necessarily have to be leviathan like government. I noted with interest that the author seems to have a quiet admiration for feudalism. The concept of a society governed by competing authorities is an interesting one.I like the idea of confederations. This is where city states compete (non violently, they are tied by trade to each other) for labor/capital etc and have their own currencies for their economic sphere of influence. Countries are incapable of such a thing, but individual cities can do this. People have different ideas about this, but I believe this is likely to be our future. It makes more sense when you think that the countryside and towns are pretty much going to be completely emptied of people within a few decades, and this looks to be an accelerating trend.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 05, 2012, 11:41 am        Clearly, any movement to change society for the better is going to need to prove itself through competition. It cannot be imposed from above. For a while now, I have been thinking about the idea of worker owned companies. I would be interested to hear critiques of the following:           The standard model for a business is employees under a hierarchy of managers, who take care of the day to day running of the company. The company is owned by the shareholders, who appoint a board of directors. The two sides of the business are seperate. The responsibility of the directors is to maximize profits for the shareholders. Usually the interest of the shareholders coincide with the employees but not always.          Now consider the case of a company where the employees own all the shares. It will work just the same way, they can employ directors etc. BUT such a company will not need to show a profit. It will only need to break even. As long as it makes enough to cover all costs and pay everyones wages, it can continue to trade. Freed from the pressure to make profit, surely such a company could undercut its competitors, while paying its suppliers and employees better. Would a business arranged along these lines come to dominate its sector?        Since this doesnt seem to be happening, perhaps I have missed something. I would be interested in people's thoughts on this.Actually HG, you'll be happy to know it is happening. I was reading the WSJ a while back, they were talking about exactly that in the UK, where John Lewis (I think it's a kind of chain store?) has each employee with shares of ownership. I don't know the details, but it is definitely going on.Similarly, there is another company near NY state, I forget the name, I think they are a big biotech label, and they are super serious about each employee obtaining ownership.Now, these are both very successful companies in very different areas with consistently high profit margins, so it can and does work. Employees are highly motivated for sure. The only caveat I have about this concept, is that if the company goes bankrupt then the employees lose their ownership of investment capital simultaneously along with their jobs. Kind of sucks.But, I can think of a few ways around that using special capital allocation instruments, won't discuss them here, but it's not insurmountable that's for sure, it's not even difficult if it's arranged correctly.By the way, there is no dichotomy between \"profits\" and \"wages\" in the situation you describe. They are actually the same thing. Higher profits means higher income from dividends on the shares, which is the exact same thing as giving the workers higher wages.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tAah the rising tide that lifts all boats. Always wheeled out....It seems the new reading assignment has arrived, but I feel I need to answer some of your assertions. ( basically I'm going to say the same things in a slightly different way, then you can do the same again!)       Firstly the minimum wage. I have to admit your basic wage idea sounds great; let's do it. I'm not clear on how giving everyone a living wage whether they work or not will avoid distorting the labour market. Surely some people will choose not to work; also employers will be able to pay lower wages ( as any amount will be in addition to basic wage, not instead) I'm not saying it wouldn't be a better idea, it certainly makes the incentives to work better.( perhaps that's what you mean by not distorting labour market) The Liberal party in the Uk have been pushing for this for years; now they are in coalition they are introducing a Universal Credit to replace all current benefits. I don't think it will be paid in full to wage earners tho, it will reduce on a sliding scale with earnings . We 'll have to see how this works out.However I have just been doing a quick calculation. The benefits bill for uk is 150 billion a year; as you say about 10 billion more than income tax take( not total tax). Let's say your basic wage is £60/ week; a fairly frugal starting figure. Uk population is 60 billion, let's round that down to 50 to take into account kids( unless they will get basic wage too? Maybe they could?) This =£3 billion a week=156 billion a year; a comparable figure.       In any case this constitutes a fairly large interference with the free market; I can't see how the market will provide a basic wage. I agree that this method will not harm prosperity in the way a minimum wage is accused of. So here we have an interference with the market that DOESN'T cause businesses to spit out their dummies and throw down tools in disgust \" Fuck this! We're moving our factories to China. There's non of this shit there!\"         You assert that the link between minimum wage and unemployment is so widely accepted that only my ignorance of current economic theory would allow me to make such a wild claim. You quote a figure of between 50-90% of economists. To me this kind of sounds like: \" if we listen to the ones I agree with its 90% if we take a more balanced view it's 50%\"  There is a big difference there.          The reason I take so long to reply to posts is that I like to research my claims before I make them. I was genuinely interested to know whether there was a link between unemployment and minimum wage. I had spent an hour or so googling and what I came up with was very much inconclusive. I found plenty of stuff on both sides. What I was looking for was real world examples of where the introduction of a minimum wage has been correlated with a following increase in unemployment. I couldn't find it. If you have some concrete data here I'd be glad to read it.        Certainly in the UK the introduction of the minimum wage had no effect on unemployment.         Now, let's consider our unfortunate shoemakers some more. You say that if we double their wages by legislative fiat. The price of the shoes would double(?), the factory would lay off employees, the firm would become uncompetitive and be driven from the market by its less scrupulous rivals.          Firstly, doubling the wages bill would not double the production costs of shoes. Raw material, electricity, transport among other things all go into the cost of production. So let's use a more realistic figure: doubling the lowest paid workers wages perhaps increase the unit cost of production by 15%. The company can either add this to the price or swallow this loss and take less profit. Either way this harms prosperity; slows the rising tide, and everyone's boat rises that bit slower.       But here is the important point. That money we took from the companies pockets and gave to the low paid workers is not gone from the local economy; it hasn't disappeared down some bottomless glory hole , never to emerge. It is in the pocket of one of the lower paid, who will spend it locally immediately. Perhaps they will buy food from a local market trader. Or maybe they club together to fund a teacher and set up a school for their children who are freed from work. Possibly they may even save up for a pair of trainers.       The point is that you have taken money from one place and put it somewhere else. It's not gone; and net prosperity remains the same. So the consequences of a minimum wage are not as straightforwardly disastrous as you suggest.         I don't want to harp on about the minimum wage too much though; it's not a key part of my platform! My fundamental point is that interfering with the market is ok. The free market advocates insist that any interference with the market is always harmful. But the market is resilient. It will deal with any alteration in conditions. It doesn't matter whether the change in conditions is man made or natural. The consequences of our interference may not always be what we expect. But I really can't get this ideological insistence that any interference is bad.      You say that below subsistence wages are economically impossible; I suppose technically you are correct. I was referring to families where the adults wages alone are insufficient to support the family; forcing the children to work also. Taking the family as a whole the wages are at subsistence level.       What I am proposing is not that we march into our single shoe factory and send all the children home. Nor that we send in the troops to enforce our decree. Rather we  in western europe and the US can refuse to buy any product that a child has helped manufacture( I appreciate 100% compliance will be hard to achieve. But I am talking about whether it is theoretically acceptable to interfere)       This will apply to all countries equally. If children were no longer allowed to work then, as below subsistence wages are economically impossible, the adults wages would be lifted by the market; the rest of the market would adjust minutely to these new conditions. Perhaps schools for the children could be funded by taxes? I know this is anathema to you guys. But again; when you take money through taxation and put it back into the market somewhere else, the money is not lost. I know, I know I can hear you \" but you aren't allowing the market to provide schools, you are setting up an artificial situation it's unsustainable\"  I really don't see the problem. The teachers wages get paid back into the economy, the rest of the market goes about its business. The children who now get educated are literate and able to do more useful work or perhaps start their own businesses, increasing prosperity. It's ok to have these little islands, it's a way of jump starting a more prosperous society. The idea that by just allowing the shoe factory to carry on making more and more money, until eventually the society is so prosperous that the workers will be better off is an extremely biased one. Even if true, it doesn't help the current crop of kids. I always get the impression, when someone expresses this idea, they aren't imagining themselves or their children in this position. These are real peoples lives. It's unacceptable to just say \" well clearly there are no resources to provide schools yet\"        You free marketers talk as if Keynsian economics have been totally discredited. It's because you all read the same books that all agree , you act as if the ideas of the Chicago school are the final word on economics. It's not the case.         A free market will never remain free for long. Left unchecked, companies will actively seek to achieve monopolies, and then use their dominance to distort the market. Workers will collaborate to form trade unions. If you try and stop this you are interfering yourself!        Climate change; you are pretty much beating on a straw man there. I wasn't suggesting that it was going to be catastrophic or that the sky was falling, merely that a change of climate will disrupt agriculture and possibly impact on the usually heavily populated coastal areas. You mention your insider knowledge of the climate science community, and that their measured judgement is different from public opinion. It was my understanding that public perception of climate change ranges from  \" not happening\" all the way up to \"Kevin Costners Waterworld\" whereas all climate scientists  agree it is occurring, while they may differ on how serious it's effects will be. The point I wanted to get across is that the market has no mechanism to deal with it.  You describe renewables as too expensive. This is exactly what I mean, as long as they are more expensive than our lovely cheap fossil fuels the market has no way of providing them. We encounter this strange circular argument from free marketeers constantly.\"if there was a real need for X the market would provide it; since the market is not providing X we don't need it and anyway there is no way of getting X\"         You are right to point out the many false predictions of ice ages etc in the past, but these were fringe speculations, none had the same level of scientific evidence and agreement as climate change.          Of particular note is overpopulation. Yes people have been worrying about overpopulation for centuries and yet we haven't run out of resources yet. This is the --man falling from building passes each floor says \" SO FAR SO GOOD SO FAR SO GOOD\"-- argument.  Do you seriously think that the worlds population can continue to grow indefinitely? At present the worlds population is supported at an artificially high level by means of cheap energy and agriculture boosted by fertilizers derived from fossil fuels. These same are digging carbon out of the ground where it has been locked away for millions of years and putting it in the atmosphere where it is slowly altering the climate. Again I say, the market has no mechanism to deal with this.        At some point there will have to be an adjustment ( back to Malthus again) One way or another we will be brought back to living within our means. It can be done hard or done easier.         The author makes a laughable point about trees: \" people act as if trees are not a crop that can be harvested and regrown\". Noone is disputing that, the problem comes when trees are felled and consumed at a faster rate than they are replaced. Again, if the market finds clear cutting virgin forest more cost effective than carefully managed forestry, and such timber is cheaper, then that's what happens.           Time and time again when reading this book I thought \" Really? You can't see the gaping hole in that           I am assuming that since this book was the first choice for assignment, that it's thought highly of in your circles. I can't say I'm impressed; the style and content appears to have been copied directly from right wing \"shock jocks\" like Bill O'Reilly.          I'm not some rabid tree hugger; I share your contempt  for Gasland. And no doubt you are right about nuclear power... I think Chernobyl spoilt it for everyone.Im only concerned with the environment insofar as it affects humanity.Anyway, we aren't going to convince each other. I'm just glad I was able to incite you to refer to yourself in the third person. Every time you do this, hungry ghost smiles.I'm going to move over to the new reading assignment now.

      "\t\t\t\tHave to run but am going to bookmark this for later comment.  I'll read through and come with my own anarchist communist argument.  I am glad to see political/economic discussion amongst people who have decided unjust laws are not to be followed and the threat of the state is not enough to keep them from entering into voluntary associations with others.  To the poster above, syndicalism would be a good starting point for reading about how we would handle raw resources, but a point that is made by \"our\" side is that we really only need to be using a small percentage of those raw resources that are being used now.  Most resources are being burned up for the sole benefit of the capitalist owning class and are not needed for human happiness and survival.  A lot more on this to come.  But basically, the people working a certain factory or enterprise should be in control of what is produced while understanding that voluntary association with all of us outside that particular venture is beneficial to them and us.  Always remember, when we think of alternative ways of managing resources, that the assumption that the current capitalist system is \"working\" is something very few of us believe.  We are proposing alternatives to a system that breeds war and inequality not based on effort or who deserves what but based on coercion and outright force.  We are not proposing alternatives to a system that serves the best interests of the majority of humanity.  As a libertarian socialist I do not consider the USSR to be communist, it was not, and the ruling class did not do much to achieve full communism.  Marx was wrong when he proposed the need to seize the state before dismantling it, we need to skip to smashing the state right off the bat.  Preparing for this by builindg alternatives to capitalism right now will help in the much spoken about \"transition\" phase from the nation state to a federation of willing communes.  Read about the Ukrainian Free Territories, note that the soviet red army crushed the anarchists who were already enjoying a stateless, full communist life.  Damn soviets! lol\n",

      "\t\t\t\tOk, an interesting read. I particularly like the description of the capitalist society where the only way a superior man has of utilizing his superiority is by attending to the needs of his inferiors. It's a nice image.        I first assumed that this was written in the 1930s, before the Nazis made talk of naturally superior and inferior men deeply unfashionable, until I came upon reference to 'big brother' so I guess it was written in the 50s?        Firstly, he makes a pretty good job of putting to bed the totalitarian system in the USSR; he is comparing a complete command economy to a capitalist democracy. Certainly in the context of our discussion this goes someway beyond a straw man all the way into a gigantic burning wicker man containing Edward Woodward screaming \"No!! For the love of God! Noooooooo!\".        I'd like to make it clear that I am no way advocating complete state control of all aspects of the economy. I am simply arguing against the proposition we can do without government altogether. I guess my position could be characterized as Keynsian rather than Marxist, although I am happy to explore new ideas. A largely private capitalist economy, but where the representative government raises taxes to fund infrastructure, intervention to protect the poorer, weaker members of society, and, as far as possible, ensure equality of oppurtunity.( to lessen the disadvantage of being born into poverty, and the advantage of being born into wealth.)           Having said that, I felt that the picture he presents of capitalism is incomplete. In the first parts of his essay, he deals in the relationship between businesses and consumers. No mention is made of the relationship between business and employees. Since most of us, not having the 'superiority' to become entrepreneurs, will be both consumer and employee in a capitalist society, this is a fairly large omission. I think people experience more difficulties in their role as an employee, than as a consumer.         Again, when he comes to characterize his opponents position, he shows a regrettable tendency to resort to grotesque parody, while blithely ignoring their genuine concerns. So, he describes the socialists view of capitalism, where the crafty wiles of Madison avenue persuade the bovine idiots of the proletariat to purchase worthless baubles, while failing to buy the basic necessities of existence. I don't think anyone has disputed the ability of capitalism to provide the necessities to those who can pay; but it's also true that consumerism can often create a desire for goods we didn't know we needed until they were invented!          When he comes to schools, he mischaracterises the socialist position as enforced academic education for all, regardless of their ability to benefit from it. I would instead describe the socialist position (NB While I have previously stated that I am not a socialist, I have little doubt that old Ludwig Von would have no problem identifying me as such. It is to this I refer) as making education available to all children, regardless of their parents ability to pay for it. I have no difficulty with the idea that some students may benefit from different types of education; streaming ( called tracking in US) is a dirty word in educational circles these days but I think it's fine as long as there is oppurtunity for students to change tracks through high achievement.        His assertion that some children are genetically more suited to education than others is undoubtedly true; but how are we to select them? IQ test the parents? Or are we simply to assume that the children of wealthy parents have inherited their parents ' superiority'? I have met enough living contradictions of that theory. There follows an odd interlude where he discusses the difference between majority rule and representative government. I agree with what he says but I'm not sure what it's relevance is here. I have read it several times but I think I haven't understood it properly.        Here, and throughout, he utilities a classic misapprehension of socialism: that Socialists believe all people are literally equal in potential, and given a level playing field would rise to equal status and success. We dont believe that but we DO want the level playing field, as far as can be reasonably achieved.         There is a thread of social Darwinism running through this text; the idea that the wealthy and successful in society are where they are due to their own merits, and the poor are poor due to their lack of such qualities.          I am reminded of an episode of \"The Secret Millionaire\" (for those who haven't seen this it's a programme where a successful businessman goes undercover in a deprived area of his city and after a few weeks decides on which community groups to bestow some of his personal cash) In this particular episode the SM was a twenty something man who on his 18th birthday was given £1 million by his wealthy father with the proviso that there were to be no more handouts, he could sink or swim. By investing in student properties( this was before the bubble burst) the canny lad had made another £million, and was able to repay his father. He seem to regard this as an equivalent feat to making a million from scratch.          I dare say that given a million start up cash I could make another million. ( in fairness if I d been given it age 18 I would now either be a) dead or b) skint with a serious habit!)          The suggestion comes again, with the unfortunate Trotsky quote, that socialists believe that if the inequalities of birth under capitalism could be removed, all men could attain the heights of \" Aristotle, Goethe or even Marx\". If we can ignore Trotskys hyperbole, all that socialists  really believe is that since being born into wealth and property confers certain advantages on a person: the capital to start a business, the leisure to develop ones ideas and interests and freedom from the pressure to earn enough to feed and clothe oneself, then, it is reasonable for society to attempt to help people born without these advantages, by providing them with a subsistence, schooling and healthcare etc. You may not agree with this idea but the conflation of it with more extreme beliefs about human equality is misleading.            In this essay, Ludwig Von Mises makes a reasonably convincing critique of totalitarianism, whether communist or fascist. He shows that a free market society is better for consumers. I have no argument with him thus far. However I don't think he really makes the case for the superiority of laissez faire free market economics over say  a free market economy with a socialist democracy. I don't think that was his intention; he was writing at a time when numerous communists states under the tutelage of the USSR and China were vying for control of the world with western democracy. He is arguing that the free market capitalism of the west is innately more efficient and serves the material needs of its people better than the totalitarian systems on the other side of the iron curtain. It's unlikely that many people would disagree.                      I'd like now to make a distinction between the free market, and capitalism. The two terms are often treated as if they are interchangeable. But the free market refers to the economic system where prices are determined by supply and demand ( to put it simply, you might be able to provide a better definition).Capitalism is a method of funding production, where someone who already owns wealth( often a group of investors) uses to buy raw materials and pay for the labour and tools to manufacture them into goods which are sold for profit in the free market. More generally a system where trade and industry is operated by private concerns for profit.          While capitalism is the predominant form of production in our society, I am very much interested in what other models might be developed. These alternate forms of business would still have to compete in the free market of course.           I'm imagining some kind of cooperative, worker owned businesses. As I said in my earlier post, I wonder if these type of enterprises could out compete capitalist businesses? I'd be interested to hear anyone's thoughts on this.                      I know it's somewhat a cliche, but it's interesting how extreme ideologies at either end of the spectrum share certain features. The communists believed that once their system overcame its initial problems the state would wither away, leaving a system of mutually cooperating industries. The miners would mine, the steel workers would smelt, factories would produce consumer goods, all without supervision. Unfortunately this version of utopia relied too much on the goodwill of all concerned; it was always going to be open to exploitation by freeloaders.            The full on free marketers also believe that the state will eventually be rendered unnecessary as the market comes to provide everything society needs. However they base their hope on the mutual self interest of the parties involved, which as we know from Adam Smith, is much more reliable.           I merely offer this as an observation; I'm working through a lot of this stuff myself. I think it's important to test ideas to destruction, to examine their weaknesses and strengths.                    I think that's enough now, I could go on but it's late and I'm aware I'm becoming less coherent. Starting to ramble....\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThank you both for the help in teaching me something.  :)I too wonder what some of the great libertarian minds of the past would say if they saw all this. I assume they would be filled with the same overwhelming delight I was when I stumbled upon this amazing place. The black market is the only thing supplying the demand for a free market as of right now, and thanks to bitcoin I suppose that almost any industry could participate outside of state control. Take Wikispeed for example, the first car manufacturer to accept bitcoins as payment for automobiles that they build from scratch. If they could manage to pull that off anonymously, then they could operate solely in the black market. It seems that with the right technology maybe we can all be independent contractors after all. It makes my head spin thinking about what the world will look like in the next 10 or 20 years. As far as the so called \"libertarian socialists\", if such an oxymoron is even possible, I am even more confused than you are. Their attempts to make life \"equal\" for everyone leave no motivation for those who come up with the good ideas. If they want to start a business and hire unqualified and incompetent people to run the show then by all means let them, but there's no way to give equality to everyone without using force and coercion to steal money. \n",

      "\t\t\t\tHere I go!   I have mixed opinions on what I've read so far, but my disagreement with certain topics could be due to size constraints that prevented the author from taking his arguments as far as I had hoped.  With that being said, I'm looking forward to the forum members tying off some of my loose ends.  I also feel that in order to appeal to an academic audience, the author, although discussing very serious topics, seems to refer to them in a manner that fails to convince me at least, that he takes these issues as seriously as he should be.  The author points out injustices and hypocrisy with ease, but so cynically that he almost seems disingenuous.  This gives me the impression that he is comfortable writing papers and complaining about these problems (something he has been doing since the early 80's), but is unwilling to take the necessary steps, at least as an individual, in removing his own contribution to them.  In the essay titled \"Civil Disobedience,\" Thoreau says:   \"How can a man be satisfied to entertain and opinion merely, and enjoy it? Is there any enjoyment in it, if his opinion is that he is aggrieved? If you are cheated out of a single dollar by your neighbour, you do not rest satisfied with knowing you are cheated, or with saying that you are cheated, or even with petitioning him to pay you your due; but you take effectual steps at once to obtain the full amount, and see to it that you are never cheated again.\"   The political authors I have studied recently had dedicated their entire lives unconditionally to the solutions of the problems discussed in their literature, so naturally I am accustomed to a very serious tone.  It is important to understand that I am holding the author to the standard that I am only because I believe the subject matter he chose requires it.  I know absolutely nothing about the Mises Institute or the success that may or may not be attributed to it's efforts.  All I can say is that in my opinion of this one work, this author appears more concerned about the delivery of his sarcastic remarks than he is in conveying a message true to the heart.  When I read this work I don't get the feeling that the author is in the trenches on this one, and when I read political oriented material I very much enjoy feeling the author's passion and desperation for success.  But enough about my opinion of the author and his writing style… Let's get on with the issues.   As any libertarian writer would, the author sees fair competition as the most effective means to stir innovation.  However, he then goes on to belittle the state, arguing that the private sector is far superior in terms of industrial development.  He continues this argument in an analogous form, referring to the state as a \"demented elephant.\"  The problem I have with this argument is that it neglects to mention one weapon the state wields and how in many ways this weapon represents a much more effective incentive for innovation than fair competition ever could.  And that weapon is unfair competition; that weapon is war.  I am going to use the author's choice of the cell phone industry to not only prove my point, but also point out the author's lack of research when it came to choosing examples to support his arguments.      The author wrote the following about the cell phone industry: \"It is highly significant that this industry is rooted so deeply in the private sector.\"  He also adds, \"This much we do know: when the federal government allowed just a little bit of light into the room, entrepreneurs took it from there to create a dazzling display.\" Now I would argue that the technical success of the modern cell phone is not the product of the private sector, but instead resulted from the combination of several technologies that had been specifically developed for military and law enforcement. That is to say the state.  Put it this way: The state's contribution to the modern cell phone can be seen as a lot more than just \"little bit of light.\"   The first commercially available cell phone was the DynaTAC from Motorola Inc.  Motorolla was \"founded as Galvin Manufacturing Corporation on September 25, 1928,\" by Paul Galvin.  After a trip to Europe in 1936, Galvin recognized the likelihood of war and began preparing his firm for such an event. For example, he oversaw the development of the \"Police Cruiser,\" a radio designed to receive police broadcasts.\"     Already things are starting to take shape.  Needs have arisen; needs that would shape the telecommunications industry.  But who's needs were these?  Did they belong to the people?  It would seem that regardless of how it required the funds, the state represents a huge demand in its own right, and just as the market thrives by satisfying the wants of the people, industry also sees huge improvement when met with the new and large demands of the state.     Three years later \"the company created a hand-held, two-way radio, known as the \"handie-talkie,\" for the U.S. military. Believing that radio communication products would be increasingly called upon to enhance military efforts, Galvin created a separate communications products division. Sales that year reached nearly $10 million.\"   It was a terrible choice to go with the communications industry to exemplify the might of the private sector.  At the time, the heavy demand for a wireless communications device would simply not have existed in a civilian atmosphere.  The premise might not even have existed had it not been for the radical, out-of-the box thinking that is demanded by the military atmosphere. Because of the  life or death nature of the business, the military has more pressing needs than any civilian ever could.  Industrial development to them is a lot more important than an improvement in business logistics to increase stocks a of couple points.  Many lives are at stake and a tactical or technological edge is a requirement for any force that wants to remain on this Earth.  Such a demand cannot be felt in the private sector and for this reason I see militarism as a much more successful form of capitalism than free trade between civilians.  Nothing changes quicker than the conditions of the battlefield.  This is also why I have a problem with the author constantly citing the history of the United States solely as a private capital success story, for in order to do so one would have to forget that this country has been constantly at war since its conception.  It is simply impossible to separate the United State's capitalist successes from it's military history and the author is in the clouds when he keeps trying to do just that.     The author demonstrates further lack of understanding when he argues against the premises of the TSA.  The following is a statement made by the author and I agree with at face value, however when taking a situation into consideration, it is important to include all of the incumbent issues in your thought process, and in my opinion, the author fails to do this.     \"Airports and airlines are a good example. Fearing the inability of the private sector to provide airline security—under the bizarre assumption that airlines and their passengers have less reason than the government to care about whether they die flying.\"     This statement does not take history into consideration.  The fact is that airplanes have been used countless times as political weapons.  Whether it be Panam 103, or 9/11, when a plane crash is seen in the correct context, destruction can certainly exceed the rubble pile of the crash site.  One role of the federal government is to protect the land from foreign enemies, and it turns out that foreign enemies have used the airline industry to carry out acts of war against the United States.  Planes can be used to strike economic, military and political targets, and in the case of 9/11, they have even crashed the stock market.  When considering federal responsibility in airport security it is important to understand that national interests are at stake.  With this being the case, the establishment of the TSA, at least in theory, can be seen exclusively in terms of the federal governments responsibility to protect domestic interests from foreign enemies.  Basically, by seeing the issue of airline security only as far as the effect it has on passenger safety, the author falls short in presenting a realistic argument, and for that reason he must go back to the chalk board.  Anyways, this is getting long so I'll just cut it off here.  Sup.\n",

By enforcing it you are by nature taking it away and freedom is intrinsic or should be to life, so the more rules you impose to enforce such freedom the more you are destroying the very nature of what being free is suppose to be.

It shows that police are struggling to cope as traditional drug distribution networks give way to burgeoning online drug stores.The May 2012 report focuses on the notorious Silk Road drug marketplace, a veritable eBay of illicit drugs that protects buyers and sellers with encryption via the Tor network.The popularity of the website is quickly expanding. Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, however the report notes that the number of registrations for the Silk Road forum rose by 7762 on February 12 to almost 20,000 by the beginning of May. The number of forum posts rose 97 per cent to 199,538 over the same time.The number of legitimate users of the Silk Road marketplace could be much higher.Each element of Silk Road transactions is wrapped in security.

      "\t\t\t\tA quick check on a relay node's stats (I asked somebody): currently 133 active connections/clients/onion-routey-thingies, constant 500KB/s up, constant 500KB/s down, constant 7% CPU usage (recent performance-geared consumer level processor).  No noticeable memory usage, so that's negligible for Tor I guess and won't impact a server beyond the usual RAM-intensive requirements involved with serving up web pages.Even if the simultaneous requests to the server exceed a couple hundred a second, if 1MB/s combined up/down results in a consumer CPU sitting at 7%, I'm sure a server with a dozen or more cores can handle dozens of megabytes per second and still have spare resources for the usual web server load (since the data coming in & going out is what needs to be encrypted/decrypted, it stands to reason it scales with the bandwidth, yes?)The forum here says the most users online ever was 169 (bottom of the page).  Apparently this guy's (consumer-level) computer is handling 133 active Tor streams at the moment and still has resources to burn. Despite the no doubt much higher load on SR than the forums here (2x, maybe even 3x the users -- honestly I really have little or no idea though, in truth), I doubt it's anything that would bring the server to its knees.BTW, if the Xbox360 is like the PS3, the entire hard drive is encrypted and keyed to the specific hardware in its specific PS3. The drive cannot be accessed as anything but random garbage with any other hardware, even a same-model PS3.  The decryption has to be done for every read/write, I would think, otherwise you could just rip the contents of the drive out of RAM with a little tinkering as soon as the PS3 loaded the decrypted data for execution.  Not really related, but I tend to ramble when I get going, heh.\n",

      "Quote from: techguy on November 10, 2012, 08:41 amWhat is that particular reley node doing?  That load seems offly low for something that is serving anything other than static content.500kb a second doesn't seem like a lot for 133 active connections.  Also even if that is correct, which it way well be, that points to the fact that SRs database is probably what is suffering from too high load.  No clue what the node is doing, just asked for the current system load and got the numbers.  I trust that they're accurate.  Details of what's going on I'm clueless about, so I can't say anything more about it.I'm not following you with the database transaction thing though. The hops on the way to the server are encrypted, but at the other end, once the data emerges from the Tor network and reaches the application layer, it's not encrypted. So what does it have to do with database transaction encryption/decryption?  Isn't the entire point to purging things like buyer addresses from the system, that the database doesn't have to be encrypted -- because it contains very little data that would be dangerous to have seized?\n",

Basically it's a half truth designed by Australian authorities to scare when what they need to do is go suck a wallaby lol. Totally a PR stunt from a sherrif that wants to spread a message in a country where the laws are so stiff and drugs so epensive that SR is a deal even if you have a good connection in AUS, It takes a dumb copper to argue that scaring people out of drug use has proven effective. The less intellectually challenged of our LE friends down under have come to other conclusions...QuoteAussie coppers bedeviled by online contraband networks (http://www.scmagazine.com.au/News/314984,aussie-coppers-bedeviled-by-online-contraband-networks.aspx)A confidential report has revealed Australian law enforcement agencies are struggling to deal with booming online illicit drug markets which promise users high levels of security and anonymity.The report, \"Hidden in Plain Sight\" issued by the Queensland Crime and Misconduct Commission and obtained by SC, paints a bleak picture for narcotics enforcement. It shows that police are struggling to cope as traditional drug distribution networks give way to burgeoning online drug stores.The May 2012 report focuses on the notorious Silk Road drug marketplace, a veritable eBay of illicit drugs that protects buyers and sellers with encryption via the Tor network.The popularity of the website is quickly expanding. Accurate numbers are difficult to acquire, however the report notes that the number of registrations for the Silk Road forum rose by 7762 on February 12 to almost 20,000 by the beginning of May. The number of forum posts rose 97 per cent to 199,538 over the same time.The number of legitimate users of the Silk Road marketplace could be much higher.Each element of Silk Road transactions is wrapped in security. The site operates as a hidden service that hides its server IP address, while users connect through the Tor network which is constantly tested for security holes by thousands of users. Users buy drugs, weapons and other contraband through the untraceable BitCoin online currency.Silk Road users further boost security by discussing techniques to hide drugs from customs and postal services, and by vetting the integrity of sellers and their products.

      "Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 amlol.. your sticking up for someone who screws sr... even after you came to me and apologized to me for being an ass regarding this whole thing you still stand up for the guy...You're a puppet!I have previously explained to you the reason for initially messaging you to apologise. I did so when mrouid's account was suspended as it appeared as though that action was taken as a result of the claims you made. When the full story came to light, and I had contacted mrouid, he explained the situation to me. With the evidence presented to me, and the manner in which each person carried themselves in the face of that evidence, along with your stated goal via private message of ridding yourself of the competition I came to the logical conclusion that something didn't quite add up on your end.I explained the above just last night; perhaps you need to lay off the drugs a little if they're messing you up that much.I'm a puppet you say? For whom? For mrouid? I took it upon myself to come to the forums to defend him; he did not ask nor encourage me to do so. I did it because I respect him and value him as a member of the Silk Road community, just as he respects and values us, his customers. I have yet to see one of these so-called \"unsatisfied customers\" come to the forum to back up you and your claims. Perhaps you lacked the foresight to make forum profiles for these \"clients\", and you know that a freshly registered profile would carry no weight and would be fairly obvious as a shill account.The noticeable lack of any of these \"unsatisfied customers\", and the prevalence of mrouid's satisfied customers, speaks volumes.Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 amI will capitalize the important wordsmrouid(99) It's going to be at least $3600 going through silk road. If we can work out an ALTERNATIVE PAYMENT  then I can work on the price though.CLIENT Hm, what kinda alternative payment did you have in mind?mrouid(99) If you can SEND CASH  (in advance) I could probably shop it around for C$2800-3000. Just right now changing btc to $$$ is a big problem (very costly).CLIENT  How would you suggest about going that route? just curious I'm not sure what way you are trying to imply lol sorry as you can tell im new to SR and not sure of many thingsmrouid(99) I'm not really ALLOWED  to suggest that but ID you SEND CASH to a DROP LOCATION that I CAN SET  up for you then that will save a huge amount of overhead which allows me to cut the price for you. But that means only if you trust me and DON'T GOT TROUGH SILK ROAD AT ALL If you want to do that you should create a pgp key so I can send you the address securely.    5 days    readdeleteDrawing attention to \"the important words\" (which you somehow managed to misspell) ensures that they are taken out of context. Having read the \"quotes\" in their entirety, and in the context which they were stated, I maintain that mrouid would not have cash sent to a drop location (i.e. a real life transaction). I don't think even you would be that stupid, and given that mrouid is clearly of a much higher intelligence than you, I know for a fact that he is not that stupid. Ergo your little story above makes absolutely no sense.Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 amIF YOU WANT TO STICK UP FOR SOMEONE LIKE THAT WHO IS WILLING TO SCREW DPR THEN YOU MY FRIEND SHOULD BE BANNED!!!!  DPR DESERVES HIS MONEY AND MROUID TRIED TO CHEAT HIM OUT OF HIS MONEY....... ANOTHER CLIENT TOLD ME HE BOUGHT 3 POUNDS OFF OUID OOE AND NOW THATS A LIE.... I GRILLED HIM ON IT AND ASKED HIM MANY TIMES ABOUT IT AND IT WAS CLEAR HE WAS SERIOUS... NOW HE WAS LYING?!?!?!? BULL SHIT.... DRP KNOWS WHATS UP.... EITHER HES GOING TO TURN THIS INTO A CASH GRAB  AND CHARGE OUID TO COME BACK OR HES OUT!!! THATS THE ONLY TWO OPTIONS... HE DID SCAM DPR AND DPR KNOWS IT..... HES ONLY COMING BACK IF HE PAYS HIS WAY BACK... HE WONT COME BACK BECAUSE IT WAS FOUND THAT THIS WAS A LIE..... YOU KNOW IT AND I KNOW IT...You were willing to screw DPR with \"SR down specials\", which I have pointed out multiple times and you stated was \"a mistake\"; you knowingly violated the terms of the Seller's Guide which you agreed to abide by upon becoming a vendor, and if you did not do so knowingly, you have not yet read the Seller's Guide meaning you shouldn't be doing business here - so drop the \"good citizen / looking out for DPR\" act.The customer that claimed he bought 3 pounds off mrouid OOE has mailed SR Support stating that it was a fabrication, which mrouid has told us right here in this thread. If he is lying on that point, DPR will know about it and take it into consideration when delivering his / her judgement on the matter.It doesn't make a difference to me or most of mrouid's other customers whether he comes back or not; we will do business with him wherever he ends up. He used to have an account on BMR and if he returns there, or decides to set up his own site, he will get our business. Silk Road will lose the most professional vendor it has ever seen, the huge amount of commission from his sales, and our community will lose a large number of contributors who strongly believe in an agorist society. We will leave this place because we believe in true justice; if that is not delivered, we will be violating our own principles by advocating a corrupt system that allows injustices to occur.If mrouid were conducting sales out of escrow he would not have been in the top 2% of vendors - his vendor statistics, namely his number of transactions, would ensure he didn't reach the top 2%.Your little scam is coming crashing down around you, and you're becoming more and more desperate. Anybody who has even a passing interest in psychology will notice that. Your continued interest and insistence here on the forum shows that you are desperate for people to believe your story; as its constructor, that is entirely understandable. Fabricating an untruth requires that people believe it lest you seem like a liar, hence your insistence that it is true - which, ironically, is cementing your reputation as a liar.You aren't half as smart as you think you are, mtljohn. Never assume that you are the sharpest tool in the box - the sharpest tool is only sharp because it is rarely used; that analogy applies to the mind.  ;)Quote from: mtljohn on November 09, 2012, 12:43 amWHY STILL STAND UP FOR A GUY WHO SCREWS THE PERSON WHO MADE THIS PLACE POSSIBLE AND ACCESSIBLE TO US.fuck that... long live dpr and  sr!!!Why still stand up for this vendor? I am standing up for him because I believe him over you, as does every other poster here. We have much more reason to trust mrouid than trust you - I mean look at yourself... You're coming across as insane.  ???Again, quit the \"long live dpr and sr\" crap; nobody is buying it. You care for nobody but yourself; you're the ultimate narcissist. I'm sorry to tell you, but such people are not well accepted by this community - as is evident by your mass of negative karma, signifying that a huge amount of people disagree with what you say and how you say it.Good luck mtljohn. You'll certainly need it - both here on Silk Road, and in life in general.- grahamgreene\n",

      "\t\t\t\tA difference Cool G, is that Bush never abused it (unless you call waterboarding \"torture\"). I don't believe his acts after 911 are commensurate with 'shredding' the Constitution. This was a new thing, non-uniformed, non-nationalist enemy, and Bush showed restraint and also prevented alot of attacks. Obama has gone WAY further, executive privelege all over the place, they use the IRS, local sheriffs and economic pressure to stalk and mess with active high profile right-wingers, I believe they murdered Andrew Breitbart and that comedian who got under his skin, not to mention Waco, and by a kind of 'reverse-murder,' allowed the Bengazi Americans last week to be sacrificed to his Islamo pals; troops in Afganistan to be abandoned and not reinforced and in general urinated in the face of England and Israel, our best allies.

His gradual rising doubt over the rightness of his position is well choreographed. Even with the mask on, you can sense V's growing emotional conflict with Portman's character. Portman has that genius that just takes over every scene, and John Hurt was so good you can't wait for him to be killed.The scene when V kills the female doctor is so well done I think Ive teared up over it a few times.Absolutely! Wonderful acting!!! And I really love that part too, how he shows compassion even in revenge, killing the woman painlessly in her sleep, listening to her apology before she peacefully dies.

I will be making a trek-hitchhiking the interstate-350 miles one way- as a female to go to the only doc i could find that will prescribe Suboxone w/o private insurance on short notice. Only a few docs here have the special license and i called about 20 yesterday , they either want BIG$$$ like $1100, or more commonly, they have a waiting list for at least 3 mos to over a year, due to limits on how many ppl they can have on at a time. And then ppl wonder why heroin usage goes up, when they change the oxycontin formulation, and restrict prescription pain medicines. I am in pain, and now sick too, have so much to do and i can't...i feel for anyone in this position. If only doctors were really doctors here in BFE, and compassionate...a bunch of moralfags sucking DEA dick. I am just putting this idea out there, i'll proly get more negative karma for doing anything other than cheerio msg. Anyone ever think the pushback against prescribing narcotics could be BigPharma influenced? Because all the narcotics (hydro and oxycodone) are generic now, and they make their big money off proprietary like SUBOXONE! And of course, they're losing the war against weed...so a new bogey man arises. I'm sure there are lots of variables to plug in, but they have to keep the LE prison-industrial complex going - for that's a HUGE lobby/influence group.. And keeps heroin from Afghanistan mkts up for their little war profiteering there as well. Don't just come back with a bunch of hate, i'm tryna think beyond the face of things. And that could be useful in SR being down so long as well. If it's true it's because of LE, nothing we can do anyway there either? Just wondering what ppl think can be done? This withdrawal crap on top of pain might have me on edge so ... and so what can we do to make the sitch better? \n",

My own personal opinion is that even if Silk Road does come to an end the wheels have already been set in motion and an even more robust alternative will spring up. The service is just too good, not just at providing drugs for recreational use but for people like me who want to obtain things for medicinal use. On a different subject, would an anonymous market place solely for Cannabis be a good idea or not? The reason i ask is because it has undeniable medicinal value and is gradually becoming more accepted around the world.

I doubt tax evasion will bother them at this point as it is happening on a colossal scale by people unconnected with Silk Road dealing in person. Hopefully Silk Road will emphasize how futile the war on drugs really is though, That's another important aspect of it i feel - It stands as a symbol for what people want and their personal freedoms. The sooner governments start looking at drug use as a health issue rather than a moral/criminal one the better i think.\n",

      "Quote from: nomad bloodbath on November 16, 2012, 09:31 amQuote from: dopey on November 16, 2012, 08:55 amDonnyberger-Im just curious but why would DPR want to block new registrations? If even more people are trying to get on isnt that a good thing? Do we (you) not want anymore users in SR or is it full? So the vendors that are there can have the existing buyers only. As time goes on and vendors fade away does DPR open it up to just new vendors? As well as you are restricting vendors to the existing members only. Where will new registers go? Thats where the vendors will follow to and SR will lose out on all of that business. When you say \"a way to block all these morons\" I assume you are refering to all the current members who flipped out while SR was down? Both vendors and buyers. As well as you must be refering to the existing members that are trying to scam for BTCs. Has nothing to do with new registers. I think the bottom line is you have an account and its working and thats all you are thinking about. Also if you consider the site going down and having its members freaking out about being ripped off is limelight I question your thinking all together. If anything it made members pull their BTCs out and others steer clear but thats what you would have anyway. New registers they wernt here when you were so by seniority that makes you superior. I have met people like that. They usually wont help other users (definately not newbies) and look at themselves as privlidged for \"being there first\" although they are just another one of the masses. Its easy to call others behaviors obnoxious when you have no investment in the object that is at risk. I would like to see (although I can predict) how you would behave if the situation was different. If you had a large amount of BTC or maybe someone elses tied up. Maybe you can afford to juggle the money around but not everyone can. Im not saying everyones reactions were sensible but there is a justifiable reason to be worried and for that and combined with their different characters and the variables of their addiction as well as their financial state--I understand as I think DPR does. Thus the reason he has handled this professionaly and not got caught up in the commotion. Everyone understands the risk and I dont think there is anyone who doesnt thank DPR and everyone else that contributes to what makes this all work (its not just DPR) but at the same time these people are also contributing to the community that is at the heart of this. They pay their fees and follow the rules. These people make the system possible and in that respect and in this particular case forgiveness and understanding should be at the top of everyones list right now. Then there is the other foot that you can try my shoe on: im a SR member who split with their significant other. I need to start an account of my own now. I have been waiting just like you. Should I be \"halted\" from registering a new account? What if it was you that just found SR like some of the new registers have. You remember how excited you were to see it? Well you cant join because your new. Hopefully you can understand where im coming from and you take this the right way. Try not to have a \"spazathon\" over it. ;)I appreciate the quotation marks on spazathon since it is my use of the word that you now misuse it.Vendor accounts are more dangerous than buyer accounts. Sorry you lost your SR account access with your gf.bf whatever significant other means to you.Barely missed the registration being open huh, I do not think personal issues with your love life are gonna hit a sweet spot in The Staff's hearts to make this one exception. I wished it had been invite only or 1 day a week randomly allowed to control userbase about 7 months ago. Too many abuse the system as it is, but never the less the registration is not closed forever so maybe your personal spazathon should relax down.These threads are pointless. Registration will be allowed when it is allowed, no one even has a quote on why it is not currently allowed.X)nomad bloodbathThe term you coined refers to the \"situation\" that took place here on SR (as I called it). The way I used it was in a sarcastic sense to imply that his reaction was of the same caliber. So I cant see it as being wrong in its use. You say vendor accounts are more dangerous then buyer accounts but based on what? What if im the president of the US? Do you think a vendor would face as much trouble as me? Also vendors have the ability to just drop off a package with no return address or a fake one if they like. Buyers have to recieve the items which is where it is usually caught at. So I think danger is a perspective. Do vendors risk more then buyers in transactions? Thats debateable and depends on different factors but I could see how that could be more dangerous. I got a divorce if you must know and it happens. Im not going to ask for the account from my lawyer. I use SR regularly so this has been a hard time especially for me--so thank you for saying your sorry although I feel it was sarcastic. I say significant other because I am not going to revel jack about myself anywhere if I dont have to. I dont care what anyone says if im vague I feel better. As far as looking for a sweet spot in the the staffs hearts that was never my intention. I am simply the voice that is asking when new registrations will be open and I explained my situation in case there was an alternative. I made sure that I made myself heard hoping that DPR might see it and throw out an update reguarding it. All of my posts have been calm. Never have I asked with pressure or impatience. Determination yes. The sad thing is do you know how many non-scammers contacted me asking if I wanted to buy an account? I say non-scammers because these are long standing members that have vendor accounts. So as far as im concerned this isnt always about community and safety its about money. Money always=greed. So while SR members may think theyre keeping the scammers out by not allowing new registers the members are selling accounts to anyone who will pay enough. Thats BS. No matter what you limit the members to you are going to have scammers its the nature of this business and in the online world. Limiting members isnt going to fix that something else has to be decided but I do understand and agree that something should be done. If there are more users then the system can handle then the thing to do would be expand to meet the market or put implements in place to weed out the scammers or else it will crash like it did/does. Otherwise other sites pop up offering the same things which is what is happening. Now I know that SR is great but other sites can reach this same height with work so its not as if SR will be the only option in years to come. There is a new site being built now that many members of this forum are assisting with so its not a matter of not being loyal to SR its just the way things go. People will always build bigger and bette/safer methods to the ones that are existing. Just to be clear I have not spazzed out or got angry irritated or frustrated at any point. Im able to exist without SR but who wants to do that? These threads have a way of going off on their own tangents so I know nothing is going to be solved here but I bet you DPR will see that new registers are in fact waiting now with these posts and make an announcement in the next update. Thanks for the banter back n forth I think this novel will be my last for today.\n",

Sorry to say as much as I'm sure there are a lot of great people there, it's fucked and thats just the simple truth. You don't even have to go that far south to see it, Virginia is far enough south to see that racism and the good old boys club is still alive and well.However, with regard to libertarianism, the doctrine I've seen/read (Stanford encyclopedia of philosophy definition) does not in any way identify race, as in, no mention of it, nor does it specify women. Therefore the concept that race plays a role will be the result of the people, not the underlying philosophy so if they are practicing it based on standard doctrine civil rights would be equal for any/everyone and if someone should impose on anothers rights people would need to decide for themselves whether or not to associate with that individual, or business etc.So this is where social justice plays a role and should in theory right these wrongs. In that myself, if I knew a particular business was hostile to a particular race, I would refuse to support it. Others I would recommend that they do the same however it's not my right to prevent or otherwise force that individual or business or organization to comply with what I believe is right. As a society or as part of a local economy I'm limited to either supporting or not supporting a business or individual. So I don't think your view related to libertarianism stands up to criticism based on standard and otherwise accepted doctrines. Does that mean if we became a libertarian society tomorrow that racism would go away? No absolutely not, but you also can't regulate it out of society either. The only thing that truly will get rid of racism is the people in the society we live in.Quote from: Joey Terrifying on November 15, 2012, 07:08 pm2)  the cable companies....they suck, and i don't have to explain this if you live in USA.  i'm asking you to imagine if companies like comcast and verizon operated privately run sewer systems in the country, with no government regulation.  it would be a nightmare without publicly elected officials overseeing their operation and implementation.  it just works better that way.  i'm not saying i think the government should operate a state run cable company, because controlling information is a touchier subject than controlling sewage.  its just the best example i can come up with to explain why i'm in favor of government regulation in some circumstances.So this tells me that you really aren't interested or clear about how a genuinely libertarian society would actually operate since this really is no different than the previous point I made. The only reason in the US that cable co's have small monopolies in areas (i.e. often if there is comcast there is no other cable provider offered) in the US is because of government agreements. So your example ironically is exactly what allows the cable co's to be less competitive and provide shittier service. Not the other way around as you would suggest.Quote from: Joey Terrifying on November 15, 2012, 07:08 pmi am a bit cynical at times, but i'm not so cynical that i think the government is worthless and should be dismantled, which is what i understand to be the ultimate goal of libertarians.  the fundamentals of libertarianism seems to be focused on the individual, and to me that is a step backwards in human evolution.  in my opinion, the way forward is through unity, brotherhood, and a common good.  i think the world would be a much better place if we all helped each other instead of helping ourselves.Libertarianism is focused on maximum personal freedoms for the individual, this is not the same as being focused on the individual and shouldn't be misconstrued as such. More personal freedoms in ANY society I have a hard time saying is ever a step backwards. What people do with that freedom however is an entirely different issue and it's not the aim of libertarianism to prevent people from abusing their freedom, there are other philosophies that deal specifically with the 'What if X does Y' situations. Quote from: Joey Terrifying on November 15, 2012, 07:08 pmyou're obviously very upset that obama got reelected, so i'll be brief on this point: though his faults are many, he's a great diplomat, he's not trigger happy or war hungry (like the republicans), and his very existence is a slap in the face to the racist, white, religious majority that has been holding this country back for as long as i can remember.  i've voted for the green party my whole adult life, but made an exception this time because for me, the obama administration is a baby step forward for progressives like myself.  i'm assuming your not a Romnulan, because i would have wrote you off as a moron and not written this much of a response if you were, but on the off chance that he was your man i'll say this:  really?  the republicans are ruled by hegemony and illogic:  denying climate change, wanting to make restrictive laws based on religious beliefs, claiming that social programs cost too much money yet carelessly spending trillions on the military which just perpetuates the violence in this world.  america needs to purge these ideas and this neo con incarnation of the republican party.and as for the ayn rand thing....i'm guessing that you too have not known very many russians.Actually again, incredibly incorrect. To be honest I wholly expected Obama to be elected and not upset in the least as I am not able to vote in US elections so I have no say in the matter. There would be no reason for me to get upset at his election, or anyone elses because of this. I was however admittedly already pissed about something wholly unrelated to politics in general and related to a few immature 20 somethings who'm I'd quite joyusly beat to a fucking pulp if thought I could get away with it. I'd of course want them to live, but only so I could repeat the beating at my whim and desire.Now that we have that out of the way. You may think he is a great diplomat, which to me says he's great at kissing ass. Well fantastic, but kissing ass doesn't necessarily get things done so that is of little value to me. If you are a crappy diplomat but you get reasonable policies passed that make the US a better country then great thats what I care about.Republicans these days seldom exist, Ron Paul is one of an exceptionally small number of people I would call a true republican. The majority are just self important asshats who are out to line their wallets and any pockets they can stuff your money into provided they can find a way to separate you from it. Which is what most politics come down to at the end of the day money. This is because money, in the real world, trumps nearly all other things. You don't have something? Money will get it. You did something wrong and got caught? Money will fix it. Someone pissed you off and you'd like revenge? Money can help with that too. At the end of the day, those with money will always have some level of power and privelege over those who do not have it. How they choose to use that is a different discussion all together. Empirical data however suggests that I'm pretty accurate on that, just ask anyone who's avoided conviction of a crime because they had the money to afford them an excellent legal defense and weren't a complete fucktard. If you actually read the definition of republican it's very close to libertarianism in many ways. Democrats on the other hand both by party and by policy are NOT supporters of libertarian society, they are consistent with socialism which is not the same as communism etc. I'm not going to actually write a book on how this is true for you because frankly I'm not interested enough to take the time to explain it. The fact is, nearly everything you've stated or otherwise alluded to is very inaccurate and not actually supported by actual facts, it's merely ramblings of someone who really hasn't bothered informing themselves and coming to conclusions without data that would be otherwise considered valid. This is to say, you are effectively displaying an opinion based on information that clearly hasn't been fact checked in some meaningful and agreed upon way. So yeah I said fuck a lot and was overall offensive, but that doesn't really change what I was driving at which still stands, but I'll clean it up so it sounds nicer:'i like that ron paul wants to end all the wars, but don't you think some of the libertarian ideas are a bit dangerous?'Guns are dangerous, drugs (illicit or otherwise) are dangerous, philosophies that espouse freedoms are not, it is the abuse of those freedoms that causes danger. If you actually understood what true libertarianism was you would understand this. This is not an opinion. It's based on a well documented and acknowledged definition from a reliable and credible source.'I feel like if we lived in a libertarian society there would be even more severe environmental damage happening at the hands of big corporations.  also \"states rights\" has typically been code for white supremacy in the past.'States Rights has nothing to do with color, it has everything to do with the state having the authority to enact policies that are set at the federal level locally either consistent with federal ones, or ignore them (as some do i.e. CO and WA legalizing recreational use of MJ is an excellent example) or make them stricter. Different states had different definitions of what makes someone 'drunk' i.e. Florida in 99-01-02 the DWI limit was .10 whereas other states it was .08 and .08 was required to recieve various federal funding for roads/highways and the like. The premise of states rights therefore applies to all individuals and not one race over the other. Unless you have some documenation from a credible source supporting otherwise thats nothing more than speculation or bullshit.'if the usa went libertarian, i can almost guarantee that there would be an african holocaust in mississippi.'Refer to abuse of freedom(s) remarks previously. Libertarianism is not a mechanism for controlling abuse, it's a mechanism for allowing freedoms.some things really need to be regulated by a government in order to work efficiently.'i like some of their ideas, i just fear that if they got into power they would throw the baby out with the bathwater in the name of \"less government.\"  don't take for granted all the good things government has done for our societies.'For as many good things as government has done for societies it has done at minimum 2 things detrimental to that same society. One will always be 'Restricting freedom' because that is simply a function of government and whatever other collateral damage various policies cause so if you do the math, that makes it 2x as bad as it is good. High scoring marks in this game does not make you a winner.'also i think Ayn Rand was a bitter, selfish, traumatized slav.  libertarians talk about her like she's a prophet...my guess is they haven't known enough russians.'She's no profit, but she certainly has written quite a bit about how governments and those that seek to take personal freedoms away do nothing but attempt to control people and regulate things for greed and power collectively and place it under the control of the few. It's really that simple.So there, not as much fuck'ing but I still think you are either willfully ignorant or very poorly informed. Both you have the option to do something about. But people are lazy and generally adverse to change so I don't have any expectation that you will do anything to change that.\n",

I felt his view on abortion to be inconsistent with his view on violence and coercion, however.

The Sonograms taken of the fetus before being aborted shows the fetus trying to move away from the murderous steel, so there's threat detection - if that's relevant. I aborted two situations as a college kid 50 years ago. Once in a while I am profoundly moved by the sorrow that these were two of my potential children flushed into garbage bags in the 1960s. Today I think it would be nice to have them alive. I think there's an ontological difference between discussing the right of the prostitute to do what she does, and the right-of-the-unborn to life. This (abortion) has claimed the destruction of 30,000,000 potential human beings.  I'm not smart enough to put this point of view into its proper intellectual disposition this post-Percocet morning, but I do look forward to others' comments.\n",

If an unwanted customer comes into the shop, and refuses to leave, is the shopowner justified in forcing that person to leave (even if it means killing them in the process)? I would say yes, since this can be construed as aggression against the owner's property.

      "\t\t\t\tI was addicted to heroin in the 70's. This author's use of objective logic makes me feel quite pedestrian in my own thinking, but I'll throw in my two cents: I remember revolting cramps and mental anguish along with snot running down my nose in the long days when I finally decided to end it. There is a certain liberation of soul and spirit in knowing that one needn't rely on a powder to make life... and here I'm gonna get in more trouble.... bearable? enjoyable? Livable? So the realization that heroin was central to my well being called out within me for a revolution of sorts. The fact that my entire family regarded me a liar-for-money and an addict, couldn't keep a job, etc., all backs up what this author points out as the downsides of prohibition, and I'm all for legalization of all drugs, but I see many are sensitive that I'm judging and prohibitive in my heroin remarks. It reminds me of the opening in a 12-step program where they intone (from the Big Book) \"that if any of our brothers and sisters can drink responsibly, fine, we take our hats off,\" or something like that. If users on SR can do heroin over the long haul - and Im not sure what that is - without it becoming a weight that says \"I have to have this powder to make the world appear right\" (a mentality that I admit I lean towards today for pot). When I found SR, Id been away from heroin and coke for 20 years. I immediately bought a bit of each and some syringes. As soon as the hit started, the whole nightmare of that existence flashed inside my brain in an instant. I started to puke, and didnt stop for 24 hours. I tossed the rest of the black tar into the toilet. But 'on the side of addiction,' the DVD \"The Marketing of Madness\" points out that early psychiatry once advocated heroin as an antidote to mental illness (whatever they considered that to be), so there you would have people saying, \"I'm taking my meds.\"\n",
      "\t\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\t      I was/am a heroin addict, although since the birth of my first child a few years ago I manage my addiction with buprenorphine which blocks the effects of any other opiate. ( haven't been able to get high since!)       Unsurprisingly I agree with everything the author has to say about prohibition. The harmful effects associated with heroin use are mostly due to it being illegal, and the high price that leads to.        In the northern industrial districts of the UK in the early 1800s, many mill workers were addicted to opium, usually in the form of laudanum. However because it was very cheap it didn't cause the social problems we now associate with opiate use. If anything it made the workers more able to endure their onerous working lives. There was far more concern expressed over mill hands who turned to drink.         In an early chapter of \"Flat Earth News\" a recent book about dishonest journalism by Nick Davies, he describes a media panic in the fifties:         At that time in the UK heroin addiction was a fairly niche market; there were a few Chinese and Turkish immigrants who used it, ex servicemen who had become addicted due to medical treatment, other medical addicts, and doctors who became addicted due to access. It was largely confined to a few thousand in London, and a few in other ports. Addicts were mostly able to support their habits by using crooked doctors to write scripts, or by diverting legitimate supplies from hospitals etc.         However, after a couple of high profile OD cases ( involving the son of a Lord or something; the British press has always liked an aristocrat) the media began a 'moral panic'  about this narcotic menace. As a result new much harsher laws controlling the prescription of opiates were enacted.          Suddenly the existing population of addicts found it much harder to get their drugs. As a result the price soared, and many had to turn to crime, OR sell heroin ( thereby creating new addicts). Criminal gangs, at first among London's Turkish community, then more generally, saw the opportunity and got involved with the importation and supply. The rest is history!            Certainly from my own experience it is the prohibition of heroin that has caused more problems for me than anything else.            Firstly; when me and my friends were teenagers, we used to buy our weed from an aging punk. He was an addict and had a methadone script. We used to ask him to score smack for us but he was reluctant. However, when he needed money to score his reluctance would evaporate! I guess this could be attributed to the high price of H caused by prohibition.              Secondly; in our home town there was a jeweler who specialized in repairing items sent from other shops. At one time or another several of my friends worked as a runner for this man, collecting and returning items for him. Many local addicts would bring stolen goods to this jeweler, and eventually he became involved with the drug business ( jewelers use a bath of hot ammonia to clean jewels. Local small time gangsters would come to rock up their coke ) As a result my group of friends were again exposed to a lot of crack and heroin at an early age. Again I think that much of this can be blamed on the illegality of the drugs, rather than the drugs themselves. ( the jeweler eventually lost his business and house due to addiction. Last I saw if him he was homeless)                I am not trying to shift responsibility from myself; I think to become an addict you have to have it in you already. Only a certain kind of person thinks \"Heroin? Hmmm I'll try anything once!\" most people have more sense. But I think that the illegality of it caused me to be exposed to it and to people who had a strong incentive to sell it to me.             Again; once I became an addict ( I used it on and off for many years but only became addicted in 2000, in my mid twenties) it was prohibition, and the high price and other difficulties that entails, that caused me the most problems, rather than the addiction itself.              I was employed at the time but found it increasingly difficult to hold down a job and manage to keep enough money and to score every day. Constantly getting weak adulterated gear that never held me gm for as long as needed, I would be sneaking out of work, asking for advances on my wages, I became a fairly unreliable employee and soon lost my job.             Like most unemployed addicts I had to turn to crime ( mostly petty theft) to pay the ridiculous prices  for cut low quality drugs. I'm not going to dwell on my experiences; suffice to say I avoided prison and managed to get some control of my life with methadone and later buprenorphine.              The difference between being addicted to a drug you get legitimately prescribed by a doctor, and being addicted to an illegal drug, is immense. My current addiction, as the author suggests, is no more difficult than anyone who regularly needs medication.               I oppose the prohibition of drugs on pragmatic grounds: it causes more problems than it solves. Drug addiction should be treated as a medical, not a criminal problem. I guess I'm preaching to the choir here!\n",

      "\t\t\t\tOn the question of heroin addicts... I think tobacco and alcohol are way more addictive and dangerous. But even those don't come close to the severe danger from junk food, sugar and soda. The medical expense for treating health conditions related to junk food, sugar and soda abuse is sky high. Yet we don't see these dangerous substances outlawed. Clearly the damage to the human mind and health is not what made heroin illegal. I blame the conservative christians who control the US government and the pressure the US govmnt puts on other countries to keep dope criminalized. There is absolutely not logic in having coke and heroin illegal while much more (or at least the same level) dangerous substances are legal and cheep as fuck... An alcoholic without booze goes through worst withdrawal than heroin addict. In fact an alcoholic can die if he quits cold turkey. A tobacco smoker has grey lungs and damaged cardiovascular system...Yet both alcohol and tobacco are free and fairly cheep. So I call BS on the drug war.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tMy own personal beliefs are that regardless of any borders on the globe, that all humans have the right to freedom. I do not think that a majority in any particular subsection of the globe can decide to take away freedoms from minorities. I don't care if there is a country with a hundred people, and 99 of them vote for 1 of them to be their slave, I support the slave. I don't care where the slave is from a spatial perspective , and I don't even really care who their master is. I think that what freedom is is pretty easy to define actually. Freedom means that you have what is yours and all you can make from it, and none of what is anothers unless by mutual agreement without coercion.  Freedom means that you can pick the person you are married to, the drugs you consume, the information you consume, the possessions you have: Without any restriction what-so-ever. Now some people may need to have their freedom restricted due to their restricting others freedom. A person who kills an innocent person should not be allowed to go free unless it was in the will of the person they murder. These are small details, details that do not cloud my overall desire for Global Human Freedom (but which many who want Global Human Enslavement will argue are extremely intricate and requiring a government to deal with, from which their cancer will grow out again). I think that ANYONE under authority of ANYONE or THING who stands in the way of these ideals should unquestionably be killed or incapacitated , and thus I consider myself to be a militant libertarian. \n",

This is however, not an -obligation-. Living within a liberal society you are fully free to share your wealth with your family, your neighbours, or even everyone in your country or in the world. Liberalism does in no way impede that freedom, it does not forbid you to share resources within a group if you choose to.Systems like socialism do force you to share, not paying taxes will ultimately result in your assets being taken from you by force/violence. Conservatives have little to fear from liberalism really - if they choose to, they can operate as family units sharing resources if they want to do so. \n",

The only people who are immoral are those who wish to force anything other than libertarianism onto anybody, my ideology is one where everyone is equal and everyone is free. So who the fuck are you to force slavery onto anyone, is a better question. QuoteIf I understand you correctly, following these examples, it would be possible for a private group of landowners to set up their own church of beliefs, on a private residency, which might resemble this; The Island Church of Free Pedos. An island retreat where all pedos and their 'families' are welcome. The age of consent wouldn't exist, as long as consent is given. Sex would be unrestricted between all consenting children and adults. You could marry a twelve year old (or three). And the church would be free to teach children from an early age that sex with adults is essential to their pedo religion, and the only way to repent their sins and go to heaven. Children are more easily brainwashed if they're indoctrinated from an early age.This would all be possible under you freedoms, and you know their are people out their who not only believe having sex with children is OK, but actually believe it's essential to healthy sexual development! They would brainwash their children to accept this (we know this is possible because many religions already indoctrinate their children from an early age into believing all kinds of rubbish), so they would argue no-one personal freedoms are being threatened.Is this the case Kmf, or have I misunderstood your personal freedoms? Would there be an age of consent for everyone? If so, how does that not impede on the individuals rite to freedom of personal choice? And how would you stop a pedos freedom to bring up their children in any religious manner they see fit?I'm not attacking you, I'd just like some clarification please. :)Certainly polygamy should be legal. As far as pedophiles rights go, I believe that they should be free to obtain and distribute child pornography, however, they are not to be free to produce it as that entails child molestation. I believe that children have the right to be free from coercive sexual activity, and at some ages children simply cannot consent to engage in sexual acts. These beliefs are entirely consistent with those of anarcho-libertarianism. Deciding the age at which a person is old enough to consent to sexual activity without inherent coercion being involved is one of the small details. Certainly the age should be below 18, for most of human existence it has actually been about 12, however in very modern times it has been significantly increased. Personally I would not feel any desire to stop people from engaging in sexual activity with people around age 13, so long as it is consensual (as is currently the law in Spain, and actually the age of consent in Canada was 14 until quite recently, and many countries around the world have age of consent at about 14). However if an adult coerces a toddler into engaging in sex I would see it as a violation of the toddlers freedom and would thus attempt to prevent this as I am strongly in favor of all humans being free. As far as what people teach their children, that should not be restricted at all. There is nothing inherently immoral about a pedophile teaching a toddler that it is acceptable for them to engage in sex with adults, however if they actually engage in sex with the toddler it is a violation of the toddlers freedom imo. I also think that parents should be free to teach their children that they will burn in hell if they do not believe in Jesus, or that Jews should be exterminated and a white nationalist government set up. Of course, if they actually try to exterminate Jews they should be stopped as that will violate the freedom of the Jews, however I do believe that they should be free to set up a white nationalist society so long as they do so in a way that is consistent with the freedoms of all others. \n",

      "Quote from: ZenAndTheArt on January 22, 2013, 10:44 pmThis comes down again to peoples beliefs in Freedom of Speech, and how far that freedom should extend. I myself believe that freedom of speech is an essential human right, and we should always strive to uphold it, however I also believe there should be carefully considered limits and responsibilities that come with freedom of speech. Some examples maybe; a parent attempting to groom their child to accept sexual abuse, public hate speech directed at others (racism, gay bashing etc), subliminal broadcasts which attempt to secretly alter the listener/viewers thoughts on a subconscious level (if this is possible), child pornography containing real images of abuse.I believe that child pornography should be legal to possess and distribute, however not legal to produce as production inherently involves child molestation which is what should be illegal. Subliminal broadcasts which attempt to secretly alter the listen/viewers thoughts on a subconscious level should also be legal, if you make that illegal you will essentially outlaw marketing and advertising. Public hate speech should be allowed on land that it is allowed on, I do not believe in the concept of public land and thus it is a non-issue, the rules regarding hate speech are determined by the owner of the land you are on. So I believe that I am more in favor of freedom of speech than you are. Indeed I even think it should be legal to yell fire in a crowded room, so long as the owner of the crowded room has not set any rule against it. People will avoid crowded rooms in which it is not against the rules to yell fire, and thus the problem is self correcting without the need to violate peoples right to freedom of speech and property. Freedom of speech doesn't mean that you are free to say anything you want where and whenever you want, but it does mean that you are free to say anything you want on private land that has no rule against saying anything you want.  QuoteHere's a question I'd throw out there for anyone who wants total freedom of speech (the freedom to say anything, to anyone, using any form of media, at any time or place, with no restrictions what-so-ever), surely it would follow that such freedoms would extend to the politician and the government? And therefore they should be free to spread propaganda (the truth of which might be open to interpretation) to the masses? Maybe even start the indoctrination from an early age - the classroom for example. A misinterpretation of history, leaving out key events and emphasizing certain sources and accounts over others, may not be directly lying but can utterly change the perception of the events and the meaning you take from the lesson. Exorcizing it's right to total freedom of speech, the government could drill home it's message to the pupils in other ways as well. Maybe get the pupils to all recite the propaganda together, in unison at the start of each school day (they say repetition is the key to accessing the subconscious). So, if all goes well everyone will grow up to be the perfect unquestioning drone, ready to believe whatever \"news\" the government and it's official news agents put before them (\"Oceania has always been at war with Eastasia\").But I guess if you have no government then you have no problem then...Well the government is currently doing all of these things that you are afraid of. Also I do not think that there should be a government. If some group of people wants to spread propaganda and lies, they should not be restricted from doing these things. Trust is quite important in a libertarian society, it is the most valuable asset there is. If a group is identified spreading propaganda, people will start to discredit them. The groups that consistently tell the truth will be the groups that are believed. I do not think there should be any law that says people can not for example put on television an ad that says smoking marijuana will make you want to rape white women. However, there should also be no laws against others putting an ad out that says that smoking marijuana is relatively harmless. The masses will come to recognize who tells lies in time, especially when scientific minded organizations come together that are interested in the pursuit of knowledge. Currently such organizations are restricted by the government, they are not allowed to carry out research on recreational drugs, they are denied government grants if they cast drugs in anything other than a negative light, and they are manipulated by a coercive organization. In a libertarian society these issues will be gone or less severe, there will not be government grants to be denied to researchers, there will not be governments to make laws against certain types of study. Intelligent people will have less trouble to recognize the truth, and the people who speak the truth will come to be respected by the masses and the liars will be seen for what they are. Already in the world of today there is an insane amount of information warfare, but due to governments there is no level playing field and so they are winning at indoctrinating people to their agenda. However, I do think it is fraud for a cigarette company to advertise that smoking their cigarettes is not only healthy , but reduces your chances of dying of cancer (unless they can prove this to be the case). Just as I think it should be illegal for a person to sell cyanide tablets as candy. The issue in these cases is not one of freedom of speech but rather one of fraud. I can say that smoking cigarettes doesn't cause cancer and I am a liar but not a criminal, and it is my right to be a liar. But if I say smoking my cigarettes doesn't cause cancer then I have committed fraud and initiated force against others by deceiving them. Additionally, there will be trusted organizations of scientists that will confirm to the masses that smoking cigarettes does indeed cause cancer. And these scientists will not be paid by the government, but rather they will be funded voluntarily by the people who they supply information to. It will be in their best interests to supply correct information to people, because information will become part of a market, and those who give false information will lose their funding. People who give false information will not be funded by governments, as governments will be wiped out , as one of governments typical characteristics is that they are funded by taxation and as taxation is theft it will be forcibly halted by the militant libertarians. Now the cigarette industry may pay propagandists to advertise that cigarettes in general do not cause cancer (people can be paid to lie), but they cannot pay them to say that their specific brand of cigarette does not cause cancer (people cannot be paid to commit fraud). I have faith that the scientific community will be much larger than and able to overcome a few propagandists, even if the propagandists manage to get some people with degrees working for them. One example I can point to today is the scientific debate regarding climate change, of course there are a few scientists who have refuted climate change in its entirety, and they are often accused of being in the pocket of big industry. However, the overwhelming majority of the scientific community claims that climate change is really happening. Conversely we have the war on drugs propagandists who appear to outnumber the scientists interested in facts, but this is a different struggle than that of science versus the desires of corporations, this is the struggle of fact versus the interests of the government. And as already stated, in a libertarian society the government will be outlawed and thus they will have no way to use coercion to manipulate the information presented to society as truth.\n",

      "Quote from: jpinkman on January 23, 2013, 06:50 amQuote from: kmfkewm on January 23, 2013, 03:48 amI believe that child pornography should be legal to possess and distribute, however not legal to produce as production inherently involves child molestation which is what should be illegal.Yeah but by allowing child porn to be possessed and distributed you'd be actually promoting its continuing production by not removing the economic incentive that drives its production in the first place. A policy like that would have the real world affect of more pedophiles (or even just unethical opportunists) willing to take the risk of producing it because of the financial incentives while the chances of getting caught would be minimized. Why? Because as soon as it's secretly produced and hits their distribution channels they cash in. Since their distribution channels would be free to possess, distribute, and profit handsomely off it they have no reason to give up who the producer is, and in fact would have a strong financial incentive not to. You could say the public could boycott the stores that carry it, but seeing as to how porn is primarily distributed online these days that doesn't prevent the websites that cater to it from being driven out of business.The real world outcome of such a policy would be more prepubescent children sexually exploited before the world. That's fucked up.You have a complete lack of understanding of the world of modern child pornography. In the probably futile attempt to give you truthful information to base your beliefs on, I will enlighten you. Although for profit child pornography production and distribution are not unheard of, they are quite rare in modern times. I will tell you the simple facts. Please don't take what I say to mean that I minimize the immorality of child molestation, as this is not the case. Also you will be incorrect if you assume that I am a pedophile or have any sexual interest in viewing naked prepubescents. It would be a lie for me to say that for profit child pornography production and distribution have never existed. Several decades ago, prior to child pornography being made illegal and prior to widespread use of the internet, the majority of child pornography was produced by commercial studios and distributed for profit. After child pornography was made illegal in the United States, it quickly became extremely rare until the internet started to become more mainstream. Production studios shut down and there were no safe distribution channels, although I believe there were some mail order services that advertised in magazines (the postal inspectors were at this time the primary agency that combated child pornography). With the rise of the internet child pornography made a substantial come back. Private networks of traders came into contact and distributed images amongst themselves, the wonderland club is one of the earlier such groups that I am aware of https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operation_Cathedral . Of note is the fact that it did not cost money to join the wonderland club. At the time a large percentage of child pornography was distributed in this fashion, freely over private forum based groups and on Usenet as well. One of the more modern for profit child pornography production and distribution groups was LS studios (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2004_Ukrainian_child_pornography_raids). Most of the modern production studios have been based in Eastern European countries and produced softcore images. They have been responsible for the vast majority of modern for profit child pornography, producing millions of images with thousands of children. It is worth noting that these studios placed advertisements for 'models', paid the children who signed up, and had as much consent from the children as a child can give (which you may say is zero, but I find a distinction exists between photographing a naked child against their will and photographing them naked without them attempting to resist, although both may very well be immoral there is a difference). Additionally, they had the consent of their parents. In many cases the images they produced may not be what most people think of when they imagine child pornography. In some cases it would not be much of a stretch to compare the images to photographic versions of the famous paintings of naked prepubescent angels, with props used in an attempt to create this effect ( an example of such a painting: http://i01.i.aliimg.com/wsphoto/v0/618796241/100-hand-painted-wall-art-high-quality-Bouguereau-font-b-angels-b-font-font-b-oil.jpg). A more fair comparison may be to the infamous brooke shields photographs, which were taken by a professional photographer with her and her mothers consent when she was I believe ten years old. These photographs have been determined by the courts as legal in many jurisdictions including the USA, and have even been in museums (with limited success, frequently they have been pulled after overwhelming complaints). The following article has a cropped image and a bit of background story, http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/6248757/Brooke-Shields-photographer-disappointed-by-police-pornography-claim.html. , the entire set is available here https://iconicphotos.wordpress.com/2009/06/05/brooke-shields-by-gary-gross/ (please note that although these photographs are beyond a doubt legal in the USA and many other countries, they may be considered child pornography in others. Click at your own discretion, there is nothing legal that more closely approximates softcore child pornography). Many people arrested with child pornography are arrested with images similar to this, but which have not had the blessings of the US courts. All of the Eastern European production studios and the distribution networks stemming from them were shut down in the late 1990s to mid 2000's. Although there have certainly been countless small scale for profit production operations since then, they have accounted for an extremely small percentage of the total amount of newly created child pornography. Skip ahead to the later 2000s and there is no police knowledge of ANY organized for profit distribution or production of child pornography. In 2010 virtually the entirety of commercial child pornography distribution was managed by a single group of Eastern Europeans (who managed hundreds of websites), and it was shut down by Interpol, virtually eliminating the existence of commercial child pornography distribution. They had a total of 30,000 customers which accounted for almost all known customers of commercial child pornography in the entire world at the time. As far as I can remember they were purely distributors and not involved with production at all:http://www.kshb.com/dpp/news/local_news/investigations/lawrence-and-leavenworth-cases-linked-to-massive-worldwide-child-porn-dragnetQuote...Channing Burgess from Lawrence and Shawn Mullen in Leavenworth were two of 30,000 customers busted for their online subscriptions....Child exploitation experts say the global bust does not mean the online universe is now child-porn free. The lion’s share of these images and videos are disseminated for free via e-mail and peer-to-peer file sharing between individuals, who often belong to trust-based clubs....Since the websites -- with names like “Excited Angels” and “Boys Say Go” -- went offline in January, the number of active commercial child porn sites has nosedived from perhaps 300 to the single digits, said Dunn.And really that article sums up the state of modern for profit child pornography production and distribution quite well. Although it is probably not entirely extinct, any existing for profit distribution operations are extremely small scale, account for probably less than 0.5% of total child pornography distribution. There are no known for profit studios or organized studios at all, and there have not been for many years now. This is not to say that absolutely nobody in the world produces child pornography and tries to sell it, it is just that this makes up such a tiny percentage of newly created child pornography as to be virtually insignificant to the global market (which is also virtually non-existent if you take market to mean people paying money for child pornography). Let's contrast the ~50,000 (adding 20,000 to be a conservative estimate, considering some people probably got away and there are probably other underground yet small for profit channels) known buyers of child pornography IN THE WORLD between 2009 and 2010 with the amount of child pornography distributed for free over public peer to peer networks. over 30 months in the mid 2000's, a single P2P monitoring operation identified 30,000  IP addresses in a single state offering child pornography for free.http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/04/08/AR2008040803930.htmlAs you can see, in a single TOWN of only 23,000 people, there were 1,058 KNOWN computers on a single P2P network that were offering CP completely free of charge and completely publicly to anyone who typed in the keywords and downloaded it. QuoteThe town of 23,000 is reported to have 1,058 known computers that sent hard-core child pornography to investigators.And this was in 2005, and since then the technology they use to scan P2P networks has improved vastly and the numbers of detected systems has shot up to many times as many. There are currently MILLIONS of computers around the world offering MILLIONS of CP images free of charge on P2P networks. There are public hidden services with hundreds of thousands of CP images free of charge, visited by hundreds of thousands of people around the world (probably millions if you count freenet and I2P and other non-tor hidden services as well). There are free public image boards on the clear net that let anyone upload anything they want, and that have thousands and thousands of images of CP publicly and freely available on them. There are hundreds of private groups sharing millions of photographs freely with their members. In 2010 the entirety of known commercial CP distribution channels consisted of ~300 sites, something like 295 of them were operated by the same group of people and shut down in 2010, and they served thirty thousand customers around the world. By contrast there are MILLIONS of nodes on P2P networks serving TENS OF MILLIONS of people CP for free. As you can clearly see, for profit child pornography distribution is extinct. For profit child pornography production is all but extinct. In 2013 there simply are not for profit CP distribution channels or production studios. In 2013 it is virtually impossible to find child pornography for sale. Almost all CP in circulation is freely available on public P2P networks and hidden services. Slightly less is traded on closed membership groups. There are no for profit production studios. CP is produced by parents and family friends, or authority figures over children, molesting the children close to them and uploading the photographs of the molestation to public P2P networks or forums, from where they are spread freely. Technically speaking, a large amount of modernly produced child pornography is self produced (often voluntarily, sometimes voluntarily but without the intention of it being distributed, too often by coercion over the internet), and this has been the case since it became standard for young children to have cell phones with cameras on them (although most of this involves young teenagers, and depending on your point of view may or may not actually qualify as child pornography). So in summary, the secret production studios you think exist do not, and the for profit distribution channels you think exist do not. For profit child pornography has all but been completely eradicated from existence. Today the most dangerous situation is certainly not for profit distribution or production, rather it is the closed membership distribution forums that require members to upload  X new pictures every Y period of time to maintain their membership and access to newly posted images. This is dangerous because these groups quickly exhaust the readily available supply of child pornography, and then in order to maintain membership people are tempted to actually produce their own child pornography so they can continue to meet the required quotas. After such a group has obtained so many images, it naturally progresses into a producers only private group as the people who refuse to produce are banned for not meeting their upload quotas. And really I think we can all agree that production is the primary bad thing. \n",

      "\t\t\t\tI suppose I can admit that I have for a long time not been in favor of legalizing the payment for child pornography, but rather only possession and distribution that does not involve a financial transaction. What caused me to change my mind in regards to for profit distribution is largely that it is seen as not immoral by many libertarians. The primary libertarian argument I have heard for why even payment for distribution should be legal, is because the payment is really for the costs of distribution. I have for a long time thought that CP possession and distribution should not be illegal, but then I must ask myself is it right to put restrictions on the people who legally provide CP, that are different from the restrictions put on people who provide other things? It seems that saying distributors of one legal thing must not be paid to compensate for the bandwidth consumed and other costs incurred, is not in line with freedom. QuoteYou really don't see the paradox in what you said? You'd still be using force in making people do things you think is right. You'd be using force to ensure kids remained brainwashed and ignorant by clueless parents who would deny them the right to learn about the world they were born into. You keep callously treating  children as chopped liver, no more than the property of their parents with no rights to be free in your world. When I point out the kids should be free from brainwashing you return to the parent's rights as superseding their child's right not to be brainwashed. You outright ignore the kid having any rights at all. You don't give a damn about the intellectual, psychological, and emotional damage done to a child who grows up fearing imaginary foes and eternal damnation while never exposed to other ideas. It doesn't bother you that kids in such circumstances don't learn to think for themselves or question authority and become religious tools enslaved to fictional ideas. You aren't even aware of mental enslavement being just as wrong as physical enslavement. You draw the line at sexual abuse as what a parent should not be \"free\" to making their kids endure while I include brainwashing as what a parent should not be \"free\" to make their kids endure because I believe brainwashing to be every bit as damaging as sexual abuse and in some circumstances MORE.Actually the way I worded my response made it not paradoxical. The thing is I value peoples right to teach whatever they want to their children more than I value children being taught things that I think are correct.QuoteSo no, when you keep repeating this as your mantra it makes no sense to me because I believe a child must not be brainwashed in order to be free. Someone never exposed to alternative ideas CANNOT BE FREE. They are not free to make a choice about something they're not aware exists. And really, saying the parents believe I would force their child into eternal damnation by forcing them to learn science so I should respect their bullshit opinion is such a ludicrous argument it's hard to believe you could make it with a straight face. It's not themselves they are fucking up but their INNOCENT CHILD! So their opinion is not equally valid to mine because theirs is based in fiction and mine is based in fact.  Science is rooted in the empiricism of the real world we live in. Religion is not. People are free to make stupid choices, but they should NOT be free to deny their kids the option of choosing NOT to make stupid choices. Is this really that hard to understand? The thing is even though religious people are wrong about very many things, they have functioned in society for quite some time now, and indeed they are the overwhelming majority of the world. Although more intelligent people are less likely to believe in religions in general, even some very intelligent people have been religious, and there are many religious doctors and scientists even. Hell, some Christians even believe in evolution, but that God started the process. So not every religious person would desire to teach their children nothing of real value. Although I can admit that a significant enough number of them would. But even though I am quite certain that what I believe is right, I can recognize that the people who want to teach creationism are quite certain about what they believe is right as well. So long as they do not force my children to learn Creationism, I don't really care what they teach their children. We could fight with them etc, or we could just mind our own business. That is what is great about libertarianism and horrible about statism, statists believe in one size fits all solutions, the public schools will teach from one curriculum to all of the students, and the curriculum will of course be biased (for lack of a better word?) as pretty much everything is once it gets any significant distance away from math (I don't think anyone disagrees that 1 + 1 = 2??). Even in the US schools they teach children many lies about drugs, I would not want my children subjected to such bullshit. In a libertarian society on the other hand, you are free to have your children taught your beliefs but you are not allowed to force people to teach their children your beliefs and you are not allowed to force people pay for the education of your child. QuoteQuoteI do think directly paying for the production of CP should be illegal, just as I think that the production of CP should be illegal.Oh? Did you just decide this? I don't recall you ever mentioning you had a problem with this before. What do you mean, please clarify. Are you referring to the paying customers of say, a premium CP website?I mean I think that if I know someone named Bob, and Bob has a little girl, that I should not legally be able to pay Bob (edit: for -> to create) pictures of him molesting his little girl. to do so would be equivalent to paying someone to murder someone for me, and even though I am not carrying out the murder I am directly funding it. However, if someone sells CP that they did not pay a producer for, and someone sends them money for that CP, I do not think that this should be illegal. This is not funding the molestation of children, this is funding the transfer of data. Unless a clear and direct link can be established between the funds and the molestation of an actual child, with proof given that the payment was sent in order to create new images of a child being molested, then I do not think it is an issue. QuoteYes please do because it seems just counter-intuitive to me. Pedophiles are motivated by their sexual urges and human sexuality is so fundamental to our biology it would be natural for them to perpetually seek it out. Thrill seekers are bound to get bored after a certain amount of exposure and move on to new forms of thrills. So it doesn't seem to make a whole lot of sense to me.I will try and get you some citations within the next two days , I am a bit too busy right now to hunt down obscure .pdfs and dig through them QuoteThis might be true too, but I also provided good reasons why. Ease of access, more choices, fresh content, and customization. But the reasons are really irrelevant. All that matters is that the CP business model could mimic the adult model and be profitable.The thing is I don't think that adult pay sites offer these things over filesharing services. To access a pay site you need to sign up, get your credit card out and join. To get the same shit for free from a p2p network, you type in the name of what you are looking for. Pay sites do not have more choices than P2P networks, because P2P networks have almost everything from every pay site + a bunch of amateur shit that is not on pay sites. They have fresh content but only for a small period of time before it makes its way to filesharing sites, and additionally I am not sure what sort of customization you are talking about. QuoteAlso I know that legality will not increase demand. I can assure you that nobody who doesn't want to look at CP today, is going to run out and start looking at CP because it has been legalized. I imagine you think that legalizing heroin will lead to a bunch of people running out and trying it as well?QuoteYou can \"assure\" me demand won't increase huh? Based on what? Crypto-religious blind faith? I'm not sure how you can \"know\" something like that when it's so illogical. What about all the pedophiles that hold themselves back that would then have a green light? What about all the curious people, sadists, libertarians, pornography addicts, voyeurs, non-pedophile philes that were holding themselves back because of how totally illegal and taboo it is and they didn't want to jeopardize their lives? The reality is that there are countless that no doubt hold back. So what's your assurance worth? Your reasoning as to why demand wouldn't increase is flawed.I said I can assure you that nobody who doesn't want to look at CP today, is going to run out and start looking at CP because it has been legalized. QuoteJust like the heroin analogy. Legalizing heroin WOULD increase demand, at least initially. Of course it wouldn't be coming from those that had no interest before but those already inclined but feared arrest or didn't have access. You'd also have opiate addicts who were taking other illegal or Rx based opiates making the switch to heroin because of the legalized ease of obtaining it. It might not be a huge increase, but the numbers would initially surge just from the act of legalization. I imagine it would be similar between heroin legalization and CP legalization. The desire for both will not change, which is the only claim that I made. The demand may increase slightly, but I doubt by much. QuoteFair enough. Let's extrapolate. The for-profit online porn industry worldwide is a 5 billion dollar industry:http://www.guardianexpressla.com/porn-revenues-exceed-5-billion-world-wide-despite-free-pornography-online-and-rampant-piracy/Pedophiles account for 4% of the population. Let's assume your stat of more thrill seekers than pedophiles consume CP is true, so let's say 5% are thrill seekers, and let's say 1% account for the various other CP consumer profiles. That gives us a market 10% the size of the adult market of potential consumers of premium CP. Remember, we don't have to factor out P2P users because this is an extrapolation already of only the for-profit adult model.There's your mechanism. A 500 million dollar market just waiting to be exploited for premium CP producers to milk. And as econ 101 tells us, when you have that sort of demand with those sorts of dollars involved, there will be those willing to take the risk to fill the void to get a piece of the pie especially since the risk won't be THAT great to themselves. Studios are easy to stealth in a home. Yes, it's true that the illegality of production will provide some deterrence. But with the possession and distribution channels fully legalized ready to fill the coffers of the pro producer that provides them content, that's what's known as a STRONG incentive for such producers to go underground and get into the game. Now let me return to my very first post on this subject to explain the rest of the mechanisms of how this would work and why producers wouldn't be at that great a risk, for which you said I was clueless because you were convinced child porn could not be profitable:And why don't these commercial producers exist today? There are plenty of hidden services, bitcoin, etc. The CP groups that have been operating online for over a dozen years consist of some of the most skilled internet security people in the entire world, it isn't like they couldn't set up a commercial distribution channel. And they already have millions of CP images to boot! But I just don't see it happening. The last group that tried commercializing old images was pwnt by interpol, but at their peak they served 30,000 customers in the entire world, which is a small drop in the bucket compared to the total demand for CP. I think that nobody really wants to risk their entire lives in jail so they can make some commercial CP that will be freely available within days after its commercialization. Quote\"A policy like that would have the real world affect of more pedophiles (or even just unscrupulous opportunists) willing to take the risk of producing it because of the financial incentives while the chances of getting caught would be minimized. Why? Because as soon as it's secretly produced and hits their distribution channels they cash in. Since their distribution channels would be free to possess, distribute, and profit handsomely off it they have no reason to give up who the producer is, and in fact would have a strong financial incentive not to. You could say the public could boycott the stores that carry it, but seeing as to how porn is primarily distributed online these days that doesn't prevent the websites that cater to it from being driven out of business.\"The financial incentives for CP are not going to increase if distribution and possession are legalized. In fact they will probably drop if anything, just like the prices for recreational drugs would drop and the cartels would go out of business overnight if drugs were legalized. There are already freely accessable distribution channels for CP that are not going to be shut down any time soon, Tor for one and possibly even more infamously Freenet which is probably one of the biggest CP caches ever. It is very difficult to prove that anyone requested CP from Freenet, because it has strong plausible deniability built into it, and it is very difficult to tell if someone originally inserted content into Freenet as well. The feds have not taken down any Tor hidden services, it is easier to trace them than to prove that someone downloaded anything in particular from Freenet. Also don't forget bitcoin and bitcoin blind mixes, which make getting money from customers and cashing it very secure. It isn't like people with massive access to CP are not aware of these technologies, so where are these huge production studios you are worried about, and where are these commercial CP providers you are worried about? The studios have all been gone since the mid 2000's and the commercial sites are all but extinct as well, even though with with modern technology distributing commercially is easier than it has ever been, there is nobody doing it currently and a few years ago the last group of people doing it were pwnt (and they had 30,000 customers in total, and they were not producers).Quote\"Could be\" is not incontrovertible proof is it? I believe there is international law in place that prevents corporations from obtaining items produced under those unethical circumstances, so if they do make their way way to western markets there's no way to determine if they are or aren't. We're not going to punish vendors of products ethically produced because some indistinguishable make it to market are we? If some ephebophile is producing and selling \"child porn\" that's hard to distinguish from adult porn are we supposed to ban all porn? No.Do you have incontrovertible proof that someone who pays to view a CP image has caused a child to be molested? Nope. Sure it could happen, but it will not happen in all cases. I could go to a hidden service, download some CP (but I wont because eww), and sell it to you for fifty bucks right now. Did a child get molested because of our transaction? No. Did your demand for CP cause child abuse to occur in this instance? Nope! QuoteThere is NO grey area around the absolute fact that purchasing premium CP directly funds and promotes their business model of exploiting children.It is not an absolute fact though, as I explained above. QuoteBut you don't even seem aware that the market forces of supply and demand happen completely organically, no matter the industry, irrespective of if the vendors have access to industry numbers. The supply and demand curve is the most basic and essential concept in economics. Are online businesses not suppose to see how much additional profit they bring in when demand of their product increases? Are they not suppose to have access to how many uniques and page impressions they get a day and see those numbers go through the roof? Are they not suppose to invest those increase profits on expanding, whether it be infrastructure investments, technology improvements, or fresh and unique content all for the purpose of capturing a larger piece of the much expanded revenue pie? Are potential CP premium producers suppose to sit back while watching the present businesses expand and not think that these guys are rolling mucho dough so they need to get in? Supply and demand market forces have been around as long as markets have been around and during much of history, vendors never had access to accurate industry stats.I never argued that CP distribution should be entirely regulated to private information retrieval protocols, but it is just a thought experiment for you so you can see that you are not really concerned with the demand for CP but rather are simply against CP in general. If the demand for CP can be perfectly obfuscated, and the demand for CP is the only reason to keep CP possession and distribution illegal, then if CP is distributed with PIR it shouldn't be an issue, \n",

      "Quotesuppose I can admit that I have for a long time not been in favor of legalizing the payment for child pornography, but rather only possession and distribution that does not involve a financial transaction. What caused me to change my mind in regards to for profit distribution is largely that it is seen as not immoral by many libertarians. The primary libertarian argument I have heard for why even payment for distribution should be legal, is because the payment is really for the costs of distribution. I have for a long time thought that CP possession and distribution should not be illegal, but then I must ask myself is it right to put restrictions on the people who legally provide CP, that are different from the restrictions put on people who provide other things? It seems that saying distributors of one legal thing must not be paid to compensate for the bandwidth consumed and other costs incurred, is not in line with freedom.I credit you for conceding that. The libertarian argument that payment would just cover the \"costs of distribution\" doesn't sound coherent. How did they come to such a determination? Producer and distributor agree on a price that's mutually beneficial therefore profitable to each of them. Producer receives payment from distributor in exchange for content. Producer uses payment to pay for costs of creating more content. He charges distributors more than the costs of production so he can turn a profit and stay in business. Distributor marks up price and resells to consumer at a profit so he can stay in business. How is money paid by consumer only covering the cost of distribution? If that were true, there would be no incentive for distributor to distribute product if he's not turning a profit. The money paid by consumer goes directly into the pocket of the producer sans the distributor's take.QuoteThe thing is I value peoples right to teach whatever they want to their children more than I value children being taught things that I think are correct.What surprises me is your willingness to minimize science down to what you \"think is correct\" as if it were no more than an opinion, like it were an art critique with equal subjective value as any other art critique. Why do you do that when science is not a subjective opinion? It's knowledge of the universe we live in based on testable hypotheses through the rigorous process of scientific method. It's founded in empirical reality, not opinion or fiction. Yet you treat it as if it had no more value than an opinion. It's really bizarre. QuoteThe thing is even though religious people are wrong about very many things, they have functioned in society for quite some time now, and indeed they are the overwhelming majority of the world. Although more intelligent people are less likely to believe in religions in general, even some very intelligent people have been religious, and there are many religious doctors and scientists even. Hell, some Christians even believe in evolution, but that God started the process. So not every religious person would desire to teach their children nothing of real value.Seriously, are you crypto-religious? If so, I think it's better that you just came out of the closet and admitted to being religious than pretend to not be while giving the religious perspective equal weight to the scientific perspective. It's OK if you are, I just think it's better if you came out and admitted it so I knew where you were coming from.I agree with you that there have been a great number of intelligent people that have been religious and still are. But these people aren't dogmatists. There are quite a few religious people that are able to co-exist with science. In fact the Catholic Church for centuries had been the epicenter of intellectual thought and scientific development. Paradoxically, theology and scientific development from that time went hand in hand where now they're considered diametrically opposed. But the church does embrace evolution as well as science and reason. Religious moderates can see religion and science co-existing because they view science explaining the 'how' and religion explaining the 'why'. A Belgian priest even came up with the Big Bang theory.But religious types like these would never deny their children scientific knowledge. They would see it as sacrilege as I do to deny ones children an education about fundamental truths of the world we live in.I'm talking about the dogmatists that would refuse their kid the chance to learn these truths (not opinion but FACTS).The thing is you value the rights of deluded dogmatists to teach fucked up bullshit to their children more than you value children being taught things that are correct. Why would you side with deluded dogmatist over innocent kids unless you are religious yourself?These kids would never get the chance to be become a religious scientist because they were denied a scientific education. Maybe it's because you don't care about anyone else but you or your kids. Libertarians I've met seem to be like that, very self centered and Ayn Rand worshiping, they don't seem to give two shits about the rest of the society they live in. That could be another reason why that it wouldn't bother you to use force to keep innocent kids ignorant of reality, as long as they weren't your kids you wouldn't care. The other reason I can think of is because you are religious.QuoteAlthough I can admit that a significant enough number of them would. But even though I am quite certain that what I believe is right, I can recognize that the people who want to teach creationism are quite certain about what they believe is right as well. So long as they do not force my children to learn Creationism, I don't really care what they teach their children.But right now, no one is forcing your kids to learn creationism. It doesn't bother you in the slightest that you would be forcing innocent kids to remain ignorant just because their parents blew a fuse? You see the only reason I can think of that you would adopt such a position is if you are actually religious yourself but for whatever reasons don't want to admit it.QuoteWe could fight with them etc, or we could just mind our own business.But minding your own business in the face of injustice makes you complicit. You obviously feel strong enough about some injustices to take a stand. But to not take a stand when innocent children are being victimized is deplorable. QuoteThat is what is great about libertarianism and horrible about statism, statists believe in one size fits all solutions, the public schools will teach from one curriculum to all of the students, and the curriculum will of course be biased (for lack of a better word?) as pretty much everything is once it gets any significant distance away from math (I don't think anyone disagrees that 1 + 1 = 2??).Sounds like you're sloganeering. Are you seriously suggesting that teaching science to all students is a bad thing because it's ONE SIZE FITS ALL? Did you that there is a REASON why there are uniform education standards? Because if there wasn't there would be no objective way assessing students from school to school. If each school had their own curriculum based on whatever the fuck they want, do you really see that being a good thing? Think about it. Why would you think the libertarian answer of utter chaos in the course curriculum is what's \"great about libertarianism\"?Quote Even in the US schools they teach children many lies about drugs, I would not want my children subjected to such bullshit. In a libertarian society on the other hand, you are free to have your children taught your beliefs but you are not allowed to force people to teach their children your beliefs and you are not allowed to force people pay for the education of your child.Guess what though. You can educate your children yourself so they don't believe the stuff you don't want them to believe. Just like creationists can tell their kids to disregard science class and believe in the fairy monster in the sky. But you don't control what your kids think, they are their own person. They can believe what they want.QuoteI mean I think that if I know someone named Bob, and Bob has a little girl, that I should not legally be able to pay Bob (edit: for -> to create) pictures of him molesting his little girl. to do so would be equivalent to paying someone to murder someone for me, and even though I am not carrying out the murder I am directly funding it. However, if someone sells CP that they did not pay a producer for, and someone sends them money for that CP, I do not think that this should be illegal. This is not funding the molestation of children, this is funding the transfer of data. Seriously though, what's the difference between you and the distributor that bought it from the producer? You and the distributor are in the precise same role that you just described that you don't think is legal. You both are paying the producer for the content. And didn't you say distribution should be legal? So you've just provided a clear contradiction to your original point. The link couldn't be clearer between a distributor buying it from the producer.QuoteUnless a clear and direct link can be established between the funds and the molestation of an actual child, with proof given that the payment was sent in order to create new images of a child being molested, then I do not think it is an issue.Except it is an issue.QuoteThe thing is I don't think that adult pay sites offer these things over filesharing services.

What I'm thinking of is say someone likes a particular star or label or series or specializiation. If you go to a p2p network you have to spend time digging for what you're looking for as far as I'm aware. If you go to that label or star's website you have everything right there.  You have all the various video standards available for download or stream and it's high quality and instant. I'm not aware of any p2p that has it all and has that kind of variety.QuoteAnd why don't these commercial producers exist today? There are plenty of hidden services, bitcoin, etc. The CP groups that have been operating online for over a dozen years consist of some of the most skilled internet security people in the entire world, it isn't like they couldn't set up a commercial distribution channel.

If you're going to start a business you run a cost-benefit analysis. That 500 million dollar industry would be if CP were legal to possess, distribute, and produce like adult porn. The industry pie has shrunk to zero with all 3 illegal with the penalties steep like you have now. The illegality depresses demand where legality would drive demand. So you make 2 of those 3 things legal you'd have most of that 500 million there to be had.Basics of supply and demand. For a transaction to happen, you have to have both. Making production illegal limits supply. But not doing anything about possession and distribution does NOT limit demand.  QuoteThe financial incentives for CP are not going to increase if distribution and possession are legalized. In fact they will probably drop if anything, just like the prices for recreational drugs would drop and the cartels would go out of business overnight if drugs were legalized. There are already freely accessable distribution channels for CP that are not going to be shut down any time soon, Tor for one and possibly even more infamously Freenet which is probably one of the biggest CP caches ever.Why not? Seriously, this is all econ 101. I encourage you take a macroeconomics class. This is elementary stuff. The financial incentives for CP would go through the roof if distribution and posession were legalized because 1) there would be no longer any risk to own and possess. 2) demand would go up as a result 3) increased demand would drive up the price 4) the increased price from incresaed demand would mean supply (which is virtually nil for pay content right now) would rise in attempt to meet that demand. But the supply would be constrained by illegality, but would have the benefit of stealth technologies and distributors who are immune from prosecution, and consumers who were immunite too. Such a condition is ripe for the price to attain such a height that it would make it worth it for commercial production to get involved. QuoteDo you have incontrovertible proof that someone who pays to view a CP image has caused a child to be molested? Nope. Sure it could happen, but it will not happen in all cases.

No. Did your demand for CP cause child abuse to occur in this instance? Nope!Huh? What are you TALKING about? A chunk of that payment goes into the pocket of the producer who then uses the cash to keep the business functioning and continuing to exploit children and produce CP. The payment is directly supported and promoting the production of CP. When CP is produced a child is molested. That's what CP is.QuoteIt is not an absolute fact though, as I explained above.Actually it is, like I pointed out.QuoteI never argued that CP distribution should be entirely regulated to private information retrieval protocols, but it is just a thought experiment for you so you can see that you are not really concerned with the demand for CP but rather are simply against CP in general. If the demand for CP can be perfectly obfuscated, and the demand for CP is the only reason to keep CP possession and distribution illegal, then if CP is distributed with PIR it shouldn't be an issue, Don't get what you're saying. You can't separate the demand for commercial CP from the production of commercial CP. One drives the other. Without the demand there's no production. The real world does not live in the vacuum of PIR. That's why you couldn't make your metaphor work. There's no way to perfectly obfuscate demand in the real world. The demand for a product is half of what brings it to market, supply the other half. The price is entirely dependent upon where the demand curve intersects the supply curve. With no price there's no product. So your metaphor couldn't possibly apply. \n",

What would not be illegal is for me to go to a hidden service, copy some CP, and charge people to buy it from me. Yeah but that's not what we were talking about though. We were talking about the distribution of premium content and that would require my model. I'm sure you could probably find some dumb tools who would buy child porn you lifted off a hidden service. But that doesn't make what you sold them premium content because premium content wouldn't be available for free on a hidden service. You might find content that AT ONE TIME was considered premium content when it first came out but due to the passage of time and antiquated technologies would no longer be considered premium.Also the typical distributor of premium content would not be like what you described because charging for content that can be copied for free is not a sustainable business model. Just like you're not going to find many people trying to sell repackaged free content as premium content today. It happens, but only by fly-by-night small timers whose extremely low profit ceiling is dependent entirely on having enough unwitting noob consumers to exploit. All the tools and techniques for maximizing profits for a conventional business; establishing brand loyalty and return customers, would be unavailable to you since what's the point? They're not going to stick around once they see the shit you sold them on a hidden service and as word of your charging for freely available content affects your rep.; your business model becomes broken. My business model is how the big boys would do it. Building brand loyalty by providing freshly updated premium content unavailable elsewhere that would appeal to enthusiasts and high rollers alike giving you the greatest opportunities to monetize your traffic and thereby maximize profits. Growing a satisfied customer base that lets you not just charge them once, but who are happy to have you automatically charge their card every month. They're always coming back for more because what you give them what they can't find elsewhere.QuoteYou seem to want to force people to know the truth, And this is where you either keep fundamentally misunderstanding me or just fundamentally misunderstand human nature. You can't force people to know the truth, even if mandated by law. What you can do is provide the truth and allow people to come to their own decisions. Isn't that what you're advocating, that people should be free to decide what they want to believe?I believe that everyone has a right to learn the truth so they can make an informed decision on what they want to believe. Because when you deprive someone of even the awareness of truth, an informed decision can't be made; whether that be to reject or accept the truth. There is no exercise of free will. How can you call that the freedom to decide for themselves when the person isn't even aware there's a question? So yes, I believe force should be used if necessary to ensure everyone is aware of the truth so they can decide for themselves whether to reject or accept it because fundamental to freedom is having that choice.Meanwhile, in your world it's more important that their delusional parents have the right to freely brainwash their kids than for the kids to have the right to be aware of the truth enough to make their own decisions. This is why I don't believe you believe your own rhetoric that everyone has a right to freedom. You keep saying how you value freedom before all else, yet you would use force to guarantee parents the right to keep their kids powerless, deluded, and enslaved. How hypocritical is that? I consider such treatment to be abuse and has nothing to do with \"freedom\".Quotewhereas I am more interested in letting people believe lies if they so choose.I'm in absolute agreement with you here. But freedom depends on having a \"choice\", and in order for someone to be able to \"choose\" one must be aware of a choice to begin with. By depriving these kids this awareness you are depriving them of the ability to choose, and therefore depriving them ultimately of freedom. And why would you do something so inhumane and cruel that is of no benefit to society or our species? Why would you use force to deprive innocents of their freedom of choice? Because you think it's more important to protect a parent's right to enslave their children. You don't seem to understand that depriving a parent of their ability to do this is not depriving them of their \"freedom\" because freedom should not include the freedom to enslave others. QuoteI believe that parents have a right to teach their children whatever they please, and although it is unfortunate that some people will choose to teach their children only religious dogma, I do not think that I have any right to force them to stop doing this.Again you fundamentally misunderstand me because I'm in absolute agreement with you here. But I also believe the parent DOES NOT have the right to enslave their kids by depriving them of exposure to science and facts whereas you do. The real world outcome is the mental enslavement of innocents. Not freedom.QuoteIn a way my belief in the correctness of the scientific process is subjective, although to me it is clearly real it could just as well appear to someone else as flawed.Just because it could appear to someone else that scientific method is flawed doesn't make their understanding any less wrong. And it certainly doesn't mean we as a society should start respecting invalid viewpoints just because someone has one. It's clear you don't understand that science is not a \"belief system\" by the way you keep referring to it like one. Its knowledge is amassed by observations and analysis of the physical world we live in. Even the interpretation and analysis of physical data have to be grounded in scientific method to be credible. It must be based in the empirical evidence and the reasoning must be sound. There is nothing \"subjective\" about it.  QuoteThey may think that the devil planted the dinosaur bones we find, in an attempt to weaken peoples belief in God. Do I think that this happened? Of course I do not. Can I prove that it did not happen? Well, not with certainty, although I certainly think that there is extremely strong evidence against it.Yeah because the devil is nothing more than an idea personified in numerous works of religious fiction. It exists in the realm of mythology and imagination. Dinosaur bones exist in our world of concrete fact. That you would even equivocate and say you can't know for sure the devil didn't plant them even though insofar as being able to know the difference between fantasy and physical reality, YES YOU CAN. This is why I suspect you are a religious wingnut and that you might not even be aware of it. That you secretly yearn to accept religion and find god but are just too embarrassed to admit it right now. Maybe all that religious schooling unhealthily influenced you in this way.  QuoteThe thing is I do not side with anyone, rather I side with everyone. Everyone should be free to teach their kids whatever they want.Here's the problem with your thinking. When you would use force as a militant libertarian, it does not matter one whit any claims you make about not siding with anyone, you end up having to choose a side when enforcing your beliefs. So yes, that you would choose to side with the delusional fanatic's right to raise their kids ignorant of science over the innocent kid's right to learn science so he can make up his own mind whether to accept or reject it means that you are taking sides. You are siding with slavery. You are definitely NOT embracing freedom.  QuoteNobody is teaching my kids to learn creationism however I do believe it is still being taught in some of its various forms at some public schools in the United States. The most recent incarnation I am aware of was Intelligent Design, which was being taught at some public schools not that long ago. Perhaps the courts squashed that as well, but I have little doubt that the creationists will just repackage it again as they have been doing for a very long time now. Dude you must be high. There's no WAY ID was taught in public schools. School boards composed of religious extremists tried to get course curriculum changed to offer education of ID as a competing theory to evolution because they argued evolution is a \"theory\" like Intelligent Design is a \"theory\" so is equally valid. It really resembles the kind of false equivalency that is so pervasive in your thinking. But you can't just change something like that because there are uniform standards and a process involved in changing them. Yet here you are decrying uniform standards which in this case prevented ID being taught in those schools and will further prevent it being taught to your kid. It's for this reason that uniform standards were developed, to prevent falsifiable bullshit being outright adopted in our educational curriculum. So who cares what the creationists do? It doesn't matter. You are under no threat of your child being taught creationism in public schools because our country was founded on the principle of a clear seaparation of church and state that was affirmed by the Supreme Court first in the Scopes monkey trial almost a century ago. Scopes established the precedent that has since been reaffirmed and upheld by every case of this nature that has appeared before any court ever since by a concept in law known as Stare Decisis as established precedent. Any attempt to teach ID would be instantly challenged in court and not tolerated. Church and state separation is a bedrock principle of our founding fathers as espoused by Thomas Jefferson. Didn't you learn this stuff in school? Ah, that's right. You had a superior private religious education didn't you? Figures they wouldn't teach you that. :(QuoteAnd the religious people say that to not take a stand when innocent children are being sent to hell is deplorable. I highly believe that they are wrong in their beliefs, but I strongly believe that it is their right to teach their children whatever they want and that it is no business of mine. Yeah because you don't believe innocent kids have a right to be free if their parents enslave them by brainwashing them whereas I think they have a right to choose what to believe.You keep returning to the false equivalency of what religious people think as if it somehow validates your point when all it does is just makes you look ludicrous and unhinged to any objective reader. So why don't you just admit that you secretly agree with what the religious people think? It's hard to believe anyone but a religious absolutist could introduce such an argument and think it was compelling. Since you proclaim your devotion to libertarian militancy you should have no shame admitting you're a fanatic. Religious zealotry and ideological fanatacism are just two sides of the same coin.QuoteI think that teaching science to all students would be a great thing. I do not think that forcing all students to learn science is a good thing. I do not think that forcing religious people to have their children taught science is a good thing.But you haven't given a rational explanation why. Your argument \"it interferes with their freedom\" without offering a coherent explanation of WHY their freedom takes precedent over the enslavement of their children. Your answer so far of \"because I value their right over their child's rights\" just isn't compelling. Do you value their rights and support their \"freedom\" to sexually abuse their kids? I hope not. Well why not?QuoteI do not think that there would be utter chaos in curriculum in a libertarian world, I believe that a majority of people would want their children to be taught science. But if libertarians that think like you had gotten their way by doing away with uniform educational standards, ID could have been taught in public schools because religious extremists were elected to school boards and/or formed the majority public opinion in certain school districts and imposed their will upon course curriculum. The irony is that with a more libertarian setup your kid WOULD actually be under the threat of being taught ID. Reality seems to have a habit of dictating something quite contrary to what you believe would happen.Quote However, I do not believe that it is right to force parents to provide their children with any particular type of curriculum. So if a parent decided to not educate their kid at all and keep them confined at home and dumb as a stump doing slave labor for them on their farm that would be perfectly ok with you too using your logic here. You seem to have a sadistic side to you.QuoteWell actually I think I just have shown that there is no such clear link.<--snip> But the reasoning you used to show that was all fucked up. Look, it doesn't matter if the link doesn't apply in all cases. All that matters is that in the vast majority of cases there would be a link because providers of premium content would want to follow a profitable business model. The broken one you outlined would not be the case in the vast majority of premium child porn content for sale because its profitability is not sustainable. I haven't thought through the ethics of what you're proposing yet, but your claim that it doesn't \"inherently\" lead to CP production is besides the point. The fact that it WOULD be the case in the vast majority of cases should be reason enough. But if it even leads to only one less child being exploited, isn't it worth it to make CP distribution illegal? If you say no, I ask how you can be so callous? So you can protect the chump changers that are engaging in the semi-unethical borderline fraudulent activity of reselling freely copied content as premium content? Why are the freedoms of chump changers to conduct their business this way more important to you than the kids who would suffer sexual exploitation by producers trying to meet the increases in demand? What if it were your kid?QuoteExcept it isn't an issue!!!Tell you what, in your world where chump changers try and sell repackaged free content copied off a hidden service to clueless noobs it isn't an issue. But in the vast majority of cases where kids are sexually exploited from child porn producers that turn a profit from your fucked up policies it would DEFINITELY be an issue.QuoteI have never had trouble finding what I am looking for on P2P / Torrents , maybe I just don't look for enough things to notice though. If you took a random adult label and tried to find every flick they ever produced downloadable on p2p you'd quickly learn how vastly you're overstating what's available and it's not even close. You’d come up short BIG TIME.QuoteI just don't see it happening. The last commercial CP operation charged $100 for access, $100 * 30,000 customers =  $3,000,000 profits in total. The demand for CP would need to be 166 times what it was during their operation, for that $500,000,000 market to exist. What? First, your logic here is AFU because you're using figures from ONE commercial CP operation which says nothing about how many other operations could have profitably co-existed, especially if the depressed demand from making  possession and distribution illegal with harsh penalties were lifted. The market was far from saturated. Second, it doesn't address how legalization would allow distribution channels to operate freely and openly, increasing their exposure and accessibility to the masses. These are factors that would have definitely increased membership totals and the bottom line.  Third, the 500 million is obviously a quick and dirty ballpark guesstimate that shouldn't be taken as gospel. If I were to work up an actual McKinsey style business analysis from more in depth research that number could be different. There was obviously a lot of guesswork involved in the size of CP consumer demographics beyond pedophiles. They could be smaller OR larger than what I had assumed but wouldn't change the fundamentals; which is that there are enormous sums to be made by legalizing possession and distribution of CP by legitimizing the distribution channels and removing constraints on demand.QuoteThe thing I am saying is that if CP is distributed only with private information retrieval, the demand is all but impossible to determine. If the demand for something is impossible for anyone to determine, then it cannot be demand that drives CP distribution.But demand is never impossible to determine and is innately involved in the reasons to bring a product to market. If there were no demand it wouldn't be on the market. So it doesn't make sense to introduce a metaphor where demand for a product is impossible to determine. That's not how the real world works.QuoteAlso with no price there is no product is complete bullshit, have you never heard of open source software? Also are you oblivious to the fact that a huge amount of CP is produced with absolutely no commercial intentions? Dude, do you realize we've been talking about premium child porn? Without demand that sets a price for a premium commercial product, there's no premium commercial product. It's that simple. And since I've been running linux since the mid nineties I think I'm pretty familiar with open source. Price doesn't have to involve just an affixed numerical figure from a denomination of currency although this is the way it's usually represented on econ charts. Demand for open source and linux is constrained by its increased complexity that makes it more difficult for the layman to use, lack of uniform customer support (too many distros for any uniformity even though some 3rd party vendors offer support), a need to RTFM everything especially when something breaks, etc. So the price for potential consumers is the time and commitment involved over other OS's. And I shouldn't have to explain how open source dev returns benefits that exceed the cost else they wouldn't be doing it. Read the mission statement from the Free Software Foundation if you have to. The return is not monetary and but instead involves other high valued intangible commodities. If there was really no cost, MS and other closed source vendors that produce dirt like OSX would be historical artifacts by now. I think I've been remarkably restrained in refraining from browbeating and telling you how clueless I know you are. So if you want to keep this civil, I'd rec doing the same. If not, let 'er rip.QuoteI would hesitate to say the vast majority of CP is not produced with commercial intentions only because of the sheer amount of softcore CP produced by the Eastern European studios, but certainly a very large percentage of CP was not produced with a financial motivation, and with the eastern European studios all shut down and no production studios currently in operation, it is safe to say that hardly any CP produced since the mid 2000s was produced with commercialization in mind.Not sure why you would bring this up again unless you remain fundamentally ignorant to the effect that illegality and the high priority the US DOJ places on shutting down child porn has on potential premium content suppliers. If anything the lack of commercial product confirms all the points I’ve been making; that making distribution and possesion illegal makes the production of premium content creation too high. The benefit to producing it does not outweigh the cost because profits are limited from demand  repressed by illegality.  \n",

Every now and then I hear (rightfully) controversy about creationists having snuck some shit into the public school systems again.  Let me try to find some examples. This actually contains a lot of information: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Of_Pandas_and_People#2004.E2.80.932005:_Dover.2C_PennsylvaniaQuoteOf Pandas and People became the focus of a litigation and controversy in Dover, Pennsylvania in 2004 after the Dover Area School Board endorsed it as a reference book. Perhaps inevitably, the ensuing court case was dubbed the \"Panda Trial\" by the media in an allusion to the famous \"Monkey Trial\" of 1925.[56]Although the board did not actually purchase the book, 60 copies were donated to the district by an anonymous party. It was revealed in court that a school board member asked his church for donations for the purchase of those books[57] although that board member had denied all knowledge of the source of donation in an earlier deposition.[58] Amid an international controversy, the board also became the first in the US to promote the teaching of intelligent design in the classroom, sparking a lawsuit, Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District, by the American Civil Liberties Union and other plaintiffs.http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/10545387/ns/technology_and_science-science/t/judge-rules-against-intelligent-design/QuoteU.S. District Judge John E. Jones delivered a stinging attack on the Dover Area School Board, saying its first-in-the-nation decision in October 2004 to insert intelligent design into the science curriculum violates the constitutional separation of church and state. This is just the first example I can find of creationism being taught in schools in the USA recently. It has happened on several occasions in several different ways though. You are right that it is unconstitutional, but so is the ban on child pornography possession and distribution and that hasn't stopped anyone from going to jail for it. The creationists do tend to get shut down pretty quickly, but it has been part of the curriculum at some public schools in the USA even as recently as the later 2000's, although I am not sure when the last reference I can find would be from. The courts do shut it down fairly quickly though, but then it just gets repackaged and pops up again. so you are not correct in saying that the entire public schools of the USA are free from creationism, just the majority of them are, and the minority that become temporarily infected are routinely quashed by the courts (until they repackage it as something else). The thing is in a highly religious area of the USA teaching creationism in school has enough public support that of course it is going to keep working its way into the curriculum before the courts can rule it illegal in its nth reincarnation (intelligent design being the newest version that I am aware of).QuoteYeah because you don't believe innocent kids have a right to be free if their parents enslave them by brainwashing them whereas I think they have a right to choose what to believe.You keep returning to the false equivalency of what religious people think as if it somehow validates your point when all it does is just makes you look ludicrous and unhinged to any objective reader.

Religious zealotry and ideological fanatacism are just two sides of the same coin.I am actually in essentially complete disagreement with the religious people, and am actually quite against religion in general as I see it causes a lot of bad things to happen, many of which actually negatively effect me. So you are incorrect to assume that I am a religious person, and actually I am substantially far from being a religious person. I am in favor of freedom though, including freedom for insane religious nuts. QuoteBut you haven't given a rational explanation why. Your argument \"it interferes with their freedom\" without offering a coherent explanation of WHY their freedom takes precedent over the enslavement of their children. Your answer so far of \"because I value their right over their child's rights\" just isn't compelling. Do you value their rights and support their \"freedom\" to sexually abuse their kids? I hope not. Well why not?Of course I do not claim they have a right to sexually abuse their kids. I also do not think that they have a right to abandon or neglect their children, using the logic that they brought their children into existence, and thus if they leave their vulnerable children to fend for themselves, they have essentially initiated force against their children. I just do not personally hold abusing or neglecting children on the same level as teaching children religious dogma and refusing to teach them science. QuoteBut if libertarians that think like you had gotten their way by doing away with uniform educational standards, ID could have been taught in public schools because religious extremists were elected to school boards and/or formed the majority public opinion in certain school districts and imposed their will upon course curriculum.

Reality seems to have a habit of dictating something quite contrary to what you believe would happen.First of all ID HAS been taught in public schools in the USA. Second of all libertarians do not think that there should even be public schools, as they do not think that there should be taxation to fund them. Libertarians believe that any private school can teach whatever they want, and children are free to go to whatever private school will take them / they can afford, and parents are not required to send their children to any particular private school or have them taught any particular curriculum. QuoteSo if a parent decided to not educate their kid at all and keep them confined at home and dumb as a stump doing slave labor for them on their farm that would be perfectly ok with you too using your logic here.

What if it were your kid?As I mentioned previously in this reply, the last major CP distribution group actually made three million dollars distributing content that was already freely available on Tor and Freenet. To the best of my knowledge, they used recycled and rebranded content and did not produce anything or pay producers to produce anything. Actually there is an extremely detailed history of child pornography that was leaked to Wikileaks by an insider in the commercial CP world, that goes into much more detail than what I have gone into in this thread. I highly suggest you read it, although it was indeed written by a sick pedophile who in some cases even minimized the immorality of forcible child rape. Regardless it is the best insider look into the world of CP that you will likely find, and again I remind you that my insight into the world of CP is largely from research and reading and not from first hand participation on any level (especially not distribution or production!). And no I do not think if it saves one child from being molested that it is worth it to make CP distribution illegal. From a utilitarian point of view (and really I am not a utilitarian, but in this case I would take such a view), I would see more value in preventing millions of people from going to prison for often unwittingly distributing CP on P2P networks, than I would on preventing one child from being molested. QuoteTell you what, in your world where chump changers try and sell repackaged free content copied off a hidden service to clueless noobs it isn't an issue.

So it doesn't make sense to introduce a metaphor where demand for a product is impossible to determine.

Due to commercialization, there may be some side channels for this information to leak through, perhaps a boost in the number of people paying for access to the PIR correlates with the introduction of more CP to the PIR. However this would be speculative demand as the PIR would still be successful in totally obfuscating the actual demand for CP. That is how....mathematics works.

I am kind of confused by what you have written here actually. Also perhaps you should define premium for me, I take it to mean high end, but I also consider linux to be high end software that is provided to me for no financial charge so....QuoteNot sure why you would bring this up again unless you remain fundamentally ignorant to the effect that illegality and the high priority the US DOJ places on shutting down child porn has on potential premium content suppliers.

The benefit to producing it does not outweigh the cost because profits are limited from demand  repressed by illegality.This is easily refuted by once again pointing out that the largest production and distribution rings ever operated AFTER child pornography was made illegal to possess or distribute. Also the demand may be repressed but it is still enormous, there are literally tens of millions of people out there who are downloading CP on any given day. That seems like quite a lot of demand for CP to me. Also essentially none of them are paying for it. PS: Another story about intelligent design being taught in a USA public school (and again of course the courts put an end to it. But it was briefly being taught.

      "QuoteThat is what the last big commercial distributors did though, the ones I was talking about earlier. I am pretty sure they didn't produce anything at all, all they did was collect a lot from freely available sources and then put it behind a pay wall. The thing is that is how most commercial CP distribution has been since the Eastern European production studios were shut down. The model I discussed was the most recent model that was seen happening prior to commercial CP's complete eradication from the internet. The model you are worried about did happen as well with LS studio though, for example. There have only been two big child porn production studios that have operated that come to my mind anyway, BD and LS. And they did have a big network of distributors and sites and such. But there have been even more distribution sites that simply collected freely available CP and sold it behind a pay wall to idiots who didn't realize they could hop on Tor and get the same exact shit. I agree with you that studios like LS and BD, and the distributors who pay them to continue production, should be treated as criminal. Where I disagree is on the distributors who are not actually paying producers to produce more CP. Ok. Based on your apparent command of the historical subject matter and without having independently confirmed these details I probably underestimated the commercial viability of repacking freely available content, at least within the CP industry. But I also think the fact that child porn consumers have shown such a willingness to pay for what is freely available also speaks to the enormous commercial possibilities for this market. In a sense it confirms reasons I’ve mentioned as to why people pay for premium content despite the fact that they could find some of the exact same content on p2p; it saves them the time of having to look for it and from the risk of not finding what they were looking for. QuoteI do not believe that the parent has the right to deprive their children of exposure to science or facts, I merely believe that I do not have the right to force them expose their children to science or facts. If the children voluntarily attempt to obtain science and facts from a source who voluntarily desires to teach them science and facts, I do not believe that I or the childs parents can prevent them from doing this. But I do not believe that I can force the parents to teach their children science or facts, or to have their children taught science or facts.You’re being really disingenuous here. So here’s a child completely dependent upon domineering religious parents for physical, financial, and emotional survival with their education strictly controlled and absent of any understanding of scientific knowledge and whose only exposure to science is the demonization of the subject by their nutjob parents. How freely do you believe that child could voluntarily choose to learn science and facts? It’s as outrageous as claiming the obliviously brainwashed could voluntarily and spontaneously choose to unbrainwash themselves. The appearance of such disingenuity makes everything else you say here sound like a complete and total cop out if it didn’t already.QuoteI am not so certain as to say that I can disprove the existence of God or the Devil. I believe that God and/or the Devil are inherently unfalsifiable (which also inherently disconnects them from being worthy of scientific study, at least hard sciences, sociologically religion can be studied of course). I do not think that I can prove that I am not in the matrix either. I certainly do not see the probability that God or the flying spaghetti monster or the invisible pink unicorn exist to be high enough for me to start basing any of the actions in my life on their presumed existence. That said I also recognize that I simply cannot disprove things that are impossible to falsify. If there is an a powerful supernatural being, he could easily plant dinosaur bones to try and test peoples faith. I certainly do not think there is such a powerful supernatural being, and just as strongly I think that there are indeed dinosaur bones. I would not go as far as to say that I am a subjectivist, thinking that I cannot know anything, but I would say that I believe I cannot know anything with absolute certainty. Knowing anything with absolute certainty would require omnipotence/omnipresence , and even in such cases I am not convinced that absolute certainty can be obtained (actually, if God were real, which I highly doubt is the case, I find it hard to imagine that he could actually be certain of his omnipotence or omnipresence). Maybe not absolute certainty. Epistemology might have us conclude the impossibility of this for anyone. But there are relative degrees of certainty no? How you might live your life might be radically different if you thought the probability of the christian narrative had an 80% chance from being true than 20%. I’m actually not in disagreement with anything you just said, just your absolutist approach based on your inability to know with certainty 100% that religious zealots aren’t right, that you can’t use some of your militant libertarianism to ensure their kids are being given a choice to decide whether to follow in the footsteps of their parents or not. Holding out the possibility of that .000001% likelihood of an outcome that you are 99.999999% certain is false seems so ridiculousy futile while making you look so small and petty it makes one wonder why you would insist on it. And even here I probably still vastly underestimated the unlikelihood of a lake of fire being a real destination for “sinners” following death. QuoteThis is just the first example I can find of creationism being taught in schools in the USA recently. It has happened on several occasions in several different ways though. You are right that it is unconstitutional, but so is the ban on child pornography possession and distribution and that hasn't stopped anyone from going to jail for it. In light of your provided reference I see it has happened on very rare occasions, although most of the time efforts were made to introduce such things such proposals were soundly defeated. But your comparison with the unconstituionality of child porn is a poor one. The founders made no mention of child porn as it didn’t yet exist. Furthermore, restrictions on 1st amendment rights that don’t appear explicitly in the constitution has long been established by the courts as constitutional and desired in limited and exceptional instances. The founders, however, did have strong and explicit feelings about church and state separation which is why courts will continue to quash these cases that appear before it quickly. Also, it’s not that the system didn’t work. It’s only that it didn’t work as fast as you or I would have liked when curriculum was stealth changed by religionists through the introduction of a storybook rendition of creationism. It would seem the lesson to be drawn is to remain vigilant about looking out for these sorts of shenanigans so they can be challenged in court as soon as its identified. Not to change the system altogether so this sort of stuff doesn’t happen. Because it’s not like a government run by your militant libertarian cabal would be perfect either. If you believe in due process a case like this would still need to appear before a court to determine and assess guilt, even if it’s a private court. Or maybe you think the wealthy oligarchs that would certainly own these schools should be able to aribtrarily decide what happened and who was at fault. But that’s still no guarantee that the oligarch will make an actionable decision faster than you or I would have liked or to prevent such a thing from happening. I also really think these wealthy oligarchs who would rule over their private property like mini-despots in your world of no public property would really do a number on due process even if there were private courts although I see no reason that such a thing would exist, if they did they would resemble how private arbitration works today. Yet as biased as arbitration is today slanting heavily towards their court’s employer, the private court in your world would be an order of magnitude worse because there would be even less checks and balances to demand equity with no government.QuoteOf course I do not claim they have a right to sexually abuse their kids. I also do not think that they have a right to abandon or neglect their children, using the logic that they brought their children into existence, and thus if they leave their vulnerable children to fend for themselves, they have essentially initiated force against their children. I just do not personally hold abusing or neglecting children on the same level as teaching children religious dogma and refusing to teach them science.OK, so tell me. If the parents had brainwashed their kids to become willing, complicit, and consensual sex slaves and incorporated it into their religious dogma it would be ok with you?QuoteI do not believe that a parent has a right to keep a child confined at home if the child does not want to be confined at home.

Here’s the rub. When you talk about militant libertarianism seizing and governing a society by force, it’s not enough to sit around passively saying you do or do not claim something. Policy would be built on these ideas that you do or do not claim which would be followed by real world effects. So the question is whether you believe parents own their children. And the answer has to be definitive as it’s not enough to say that “you do not claim that parents own their children” because you’re the one proposing to run a society by your ideals so you really should start making claims instead of trying to dodge these sorts of big picture questions by only stating what you do not claim. You either claim parents own their children or claim they do not and if the latter you should be willing to stop parents doing this with force if necessary or else what’s the point of making such a claim? Because really, I'm still have the hardest time wrapping my head around what this militant libertarian silliness would look like in actuality. No government. Just roving packs of armed-to-the-teeth militant libertarian vigilantes going around like a gang of thugs enforcing private law with brute force against those they suspect of violating the law as arbitrarily decreed by their employer. Judge, jury, and likely executioners too all wrapped up into one uber administrator of justice y0h? Just think of how much dough would be saved for not having to spend a dime on due process in this world where everyone is \"free\". Oh yeah, but that's not public money going to a public court again. The dime is being saved by the mini-despot who owns the property and goes instead to his private pinkerton army to enforce his law. The price of freedom y0h.QuoteFrom a utilitarian point of view (and really I am not a utilitarian, but in this case I would take such a view), I would see more value in preventing millions of people from going to prison for often unwittingly distributing CP on P2P networks, than I would on preventing one child from being molested. Trust me when I say I would never accuse you of being utilitarian. Your ruthless refusal so far to waver from ideology in order to spare even one child from sexual exploitation or religious brainwashing makes it rather clear you are more an anti-utilitarian that is opportunistically adopting the ostensible utilitarianism of this specious argument for less-than-utilitarian reasons. But as to your noble cause of wanting to save the \"unwittingly distributing\" dupes, you said yourself that LE is pretty good these days about distinguishing the unwitting from the intentional when deciding who and who not to pursue. So now you're claiming there are \"millions of unwitting distributors\" getting popped today? It doesn't sound as utilitarian as you're making it out to be because AFAICT, you're pulling these numbers out of your ass.QuoteI am against trading liberty and freedom for a little temporary protection. What is little or temporary about protecting kids from sexual exploitation?Correct me if I’m wrong but what I hear you saying then is that you now believe the purchase or distribution of child porn from its producer (as opposed to repackaged content) should be illegal but you have no way of enforcing that illegality since there would be no good way to determine whether a distributor is knew the producer?QuoteBut I guess I can agree with you here for the most part, membership would have increased and so would the bottom line. But again this distributor was not producing they were selling old rebranded images from P2P networks and other sources. So just think of the mountain of cash they would have made had they been producing fresh quality content instead of recycling.QuoteI am kind of confused by what you have written here actually. Also perhaps you should define premium for me, I take it to mean high end, but I also consider linux to be high end software that is provided to me for no financial charge so....You have the right idea of what you think the word “premium” means. What I’m pointing out is how asinine it is for you to try and claim the open source business model is the same as the for-free child porn business model. It’s ludicrous. Open source thrives on the supply side because it’s supported by numerous businesses like system integrators that stand to gain monetarily from lowered marginal costs and an increased customer base from switching to open source. Hardware manufacturers sell more units when their consumer products use open source than bullshit proprietary source. Who are the big money business patrons that support the for-free child porn industry to raise it to the level of being able to call it “high end”?Open source developers code it for free for the prestige, bragging rights, and to bolster their professional pedigrees. There are indirect but real financial rewards from raising their profile this way. They also do it because they can; code needs to be written to support this piece of hardware they have and no one else had done it yet so if they don’t do it themselves they can’t use it. They have the need and skillz. Amateur child porn producers do it for sick thrills and voyeuristic and exhibitionary reasons. They’re not all about raising the profiles for bragging rights unless they’re looking to get popped and take themselves out of the game. They’re not doing it to improve the financial rewards in their professional life. And the average amateur producer will have neither the time, resources, nor skillz to produce high end content. The small percentage of them who do have the time, resources, and skillz are have no incentive to get in the game of producing high end content right now. Why? Because the risks are too high and the return of investment too low as there are no easy ways to monetize the return on their high end content. There’s huge demand for drugs through the mail too, you don’t think vendors would stop vending on SR should bitcoin become defunct even though enormous demand would remain? Of course they would. The inability to monetize demand makes it not worth the expense for businesses. Simple economics. Costs exceed benefits. So now you’re proposing to remove price controls that hold the price at zero by legalizing possession and distribution. Now all that demand that couldn’t be previously monetized can be. So what do you think happens from the deluge of demand genius? Premium content providers would see the enormous returns waiting to be had and fire up production again. Why? Because the distribution channels that provide spigots of cash would be turned on and eager to do business again. Supply and Demand really isn’t difficult to understand even without a macro background. You just have to be willing to think through all the issues.QuoteIf not for commercialization you could indeed use PIR to perfectly obfuscate the demand for CP. Due to commercialization, there may be some side channels for this information to leak through, perhaps a boost in the number of people paying for access to the PIR correlates with the introduction of more CP to the PIR. However this would be speculative demand as the PIR would still be successful in totally obfuscating the actual demand for CP. That is how....mathematics works. I don’t see how you can call marked increases to the bottom line through sales “speculative” demand. Looks like a tangible increase in demand to me. And since we are discussing commercialization, I still don’t see the use of this metaphor. I’m against legalizing possession and distribution because of the harm it incurs. If these acts happened in a vacuum that made it impossible to harm anyone else I wouldn’t be. If it didn't harm anyone sexual attraction to prepubescent children could just be another sexual fetish, a sexual preference even, and I wouldn't give two shits about what pedophiles did. But it’s not useful to speculate on that because facts don’t exist independently in vacuums IRL. And we are talking about child porn and not widgets in a mental masurbatory math exercise.QuoteThis is easily refuted by once again pointing out that the largest production and distribution rings ever operated AFTER child pornography was made illegal to possess or distribute.But this argument is specious because after it was outlawed the explosion of the net meant technology was developing at a rate that outpaced LE's ability to enforce the laws on the books, which meant there was far less risk involved for those who defied the law. LE techniques and efficacy gradually caught up over time. I thought this truth was self evident from the way you presented your enormous hagiography to child porn in your original response on this subject. So I’m not sure why you keep repeating what appears to me a conspicuously specious argument.Furthermore, knowledge of the heavy psychological damage incurred upon victims of child sex abuse has only become prominent over the last 30 years or so with awareness spreading gradually during that time around the globe. It's why massive underage sex scandals could even come to light at all against religious orgs as powerful as the Catholic Church. It's why pedos like Gary Glitter can find no safe refuge in the world where he can safely practice his desire of underage sex, while serial child sex abuser Jimmy Saville could go to town on hoards of children and have it all complicitously hushed up by mobs of enablers back in the seventies. QuoteAlso the demand may be repressed but it is still enormous, there are literally tens of millions of people out there who are downloading CP on any given day. That seems like quite a lot of demand for CP to me. Also essentially none of them are paying for it. Although I’m not familiar with the numbers you admitted yourself there are large numbers doing this unwittingly who have no idea CP is mingled in with the jailbait porn they are downloading. But I absolutely agree the demand is enormous. Just think of the type of floodgates you’d be opening by repealing its illegality and the kind of profits that could be made by creating original premium content for a crowd so willing to fork over cold hard cash for recycled images.\n",

      "Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pm How is money paid by consumer only covering the cost of distribution? If that were true, there would be no incentive for distributor to distribute product if he's not turning a profit. The money paid by consumer goes directly into the pocket of the producer sans the distributor's take.The problem with making no distinction between simply distributing child pornography and the production of child pornography, is that there is a very real moral difference between harming children and not harming children.Once you take the harm of real physical children out of the equation, then it becomes a very dull power struggle among elites and a matter of propaganda between countries as to whom should control whom.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmWhat surprises me is your willingness to minimize science down to what you \"think is correct\" as if it were no more than an opinion, like it were an art critique with equal subjective value as any other art critique. Why do you do that when science is not a subjective opinion? It's knowledge of the universe we live in based on testable hypotheses through the rigorous process of scientific method. It's founded in empirical reality, not opinion or fiction. Yet you treat it as if it had no more value than an opinion. It's really bizarre. I like this argument, because it makes it clear that both of you want to make schools teach what you think they should.Schools should be forced to teach their curriculums based on Scientific understanding as we currently understand it.Schools should be forced to teach only current Science. However, who is going to make them?The government?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmSeriously, are you crypto-religious? If so, I think it's better that you just came out of the closet and admitted to being religious than pretend to not be while giving the religious perspective equal weight to the scientific perspective. It's OK if you are, I just think it's better if you came out and admitted it so I knew where you were coming from.He's right for hiding the fact if he's religious, as he's outnumbered severely.Most people on Tor hide their identities not merely because we're dealing in the traffic of contraband, but also because of certain groups forcing the situation of contraband and its traffic upon us.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmI agree with you that there have been a great number of intelligent people that have been religious and still are. But these people aren't dogmatists. There are quite a few religious people that are able to co-exist with science.The culture among the Scientific community and the culture among certain denominations of certain mainstream religions are not compatible, arguing that the culture of Christianity or Islam is somehow compatible with the culture of the Scientific community is like arguing that it does not matter that you believe the sky is purple, I will tolerate your delusions in exchange for not being shot for saying the world is not flat.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pm In fact the Catholic Church for centuries had been the epicenter of intellectual thought and scientific development.During the Dark Ages. My dad is Catholic, and he feels that the Enlightenment was a great betrayal, even greater than the Protestant churches all turning against Rome and the Pope.I love my Dad dearly, and I think he's a great person, but that does not mean he's factually correct.Although the Church contained many great luminary minds, they also are responsible for witch hunts and the Crusades. Let us not forget that.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmBut religious types like these would never deny their children scientific knowledge. They would see it as sacrilege as I do to deny ones children an education about fundamental truths of the world we live in.Not all people are willing to allow their children to make up their own minds.Not all people think that religion is something that should stand rigorous Scientific validation and testing.My dad sees no conflict between Science and Reason, and his Church, and although I have to admit that the Catholics are very professional and rigorous in their thinking, it does not change the fact that the Catholic Church invented the word dogma.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmI'm talking about the dogmatists that would refuse their kid the chance to learn these truths (not opinion but FACTS).Children are smart and often arrive at the truth without parental permission. This is why schools exist, to beat the truth out of children.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmThe thing is you value the rights of deluded dogmatists to teach fucked up bullshit to their children more than you value children being taught things that are correct. Why would you side with deluded dogmatist over innocent kids unless you are religious yourself?So you are no different, you want to teach Science and Reason to children against their parents' wishes? You want to use the Big Stick of Government to tear families apart.Lets say that it is morally fine that you destroy families and go against parental authority on anything.What do you replace those families with? Do you have an alternative?Are you willing to design and pay for an alternative?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmThese kids would never get the chance to be become a religious scientist because they were denied a scientific education. Maybe it's because you don't care about anyone else but you or your kids. Do you have children? Do you plan on having children?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmLibertarians I've met seem to be like that, very self centered and Ayn Rand worshiping, they don't seem to give two shits about the rest of the society they live in. That could be another reason why that it wouldn't bother you to use force to keep innocent kids ignorant of reality, as long as they weren't your kids you wouldn't care. The other reason I can think of is because you are religious.I like this statement. So whose responsibility is it to take these children away from their families and teach them Science?Do you think real Science is taught in schools? If not, what would you do about it?What would you do? Just leave the children homeless, or worse, in foster homes?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmBut right now, no one is forcing your kids to learn creationism. It doesn't bother you in the slightest that you would be forcing innocent kids to remain ignorant just because their parents blew a fuse? You see the only reason I can think of that you would adopt such a position is if you are actually religious yourself but for whatever reasons don't want to admit it.He's right for hiding it.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmBut minding your own business in the face of injustice makes you complicit. Damn right it does.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmYou obviously feel strong enough about some injustices to take a stand. But to not take a stand when innocent children are being victimized is deplorable.You have no idea what I have seen.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmSounds like you're sloganeering. Are you seriously suggesting that teaching science to all students is a bad thing because it's ONE SIZE FITS ALL? Is it your opinion that the scientific community is without fault, without arrogance, without factual incorrectness?Even if the scientific community has the best story, which not everyone believes, is it your place to teach children The Truth?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmDid you that there is a REASON why there are uniform education standards? Because if there wasn't there would be no objective way assessing students from school to school. If each school had their own curriculum based on whatever the fuck they want, do you really see that being a good thing?I don't see why we need a government entity telling us what to teach to our kids. Like they know fuck all.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmThink about it. Why would you think the libertarian answer of utter chaos in the course curriculum is what's \"great about libertarianism\"?Anarchy is not chaos.The opposite of some agency telling us what to teach our kids, regardless of their credentials, if any, is not chaos.If we were to outlaw centralized curriculum, the obvious outcome would be that schools would use a number of certification agencies to ensure their schoolchildren could prove their capacity to get the job done. These certification agencies would all compete for the role of issuing the best certifications.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmGuess what though. You can educate your children yourself so they don't believe the stuff you don't want them to believe. Just like creationists can tell their kids to disregard science class and believe in the fairy monster in the sky. But you don't control what your kids think, they are their own person. They can believe what they want.You mad, bro? You are correct, however, parents should be responsible for teaching their own children. We do not need a government agency for any of that.We can teach our children about Eris and the importance of worshipping Discordia, or even better, we could teach our kids all about the importance of Pastafarianism and about the noble struggles of the Flying Spaghetti Monster.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmSeriously though, what's the difference between you and the distributor that bought it from the producer? You and the distributor are in the precise same role that you just described that you don't think is legal.So you think that the government should make transmitting money illegal? You realize this is why Bitcoin is so important, right?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmYou both are paying the producer for the content. And didn't you say distribution should be legal? So you've just provided a clear contradiction to your original point. The link couldn't be clearer between a distributor buying it from the producer.The problem here is that you are deliberately ignoring the distinction between directly funding the actual harm of children and distributing content after the fact.https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andreas_VesaliusScience and medicine has made great progress due to Andreas Vesalius's work on anatomy, digging up dead corpses from graves, and then dissecting them in a secret laboratory.You would throw away the entire field of human anatomy if you tried to avoid using the priceless documentation and content that was discovered from Andreas Vesalius.His documentation of human anatomy is called De Humani Corporis Fabrica, in case you were curious.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmExcept it is an issue.What is an issue, jpinkman, is that you'd give government vast powers, and think they would not abuse that power. That is folly.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmWhich p2p networks are you talking about?Your mother's P2P network is to one to which he is referring.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmWhat I'm thinking of is say someone likes a particular star or label or series or specializiation. If you go to a p2p network you have to spend time digging for what you're looking for as far as I'm aware. If you go to that label or star's website you have everything right there.  You have all the various video standards available for download or stream and it's high quality and instant. I'm not aware of any p2p that has it all and has that kind of variety.There are some private trackers to which you are not invited that offer choices like that.Also, Interpol needs to suck a cock, seriously.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmRisks and costs outweigh the benefits today. If you're going to start a business you run a cost-benefit analysis. That 500 million dollar industry would be if CP were legal to possess, distribute, and produce like adult porn. The industry pie has shrunk to zero with all 3 illegal with the penalties steep like you have now. The illegality depresses demand where legality would drive demand. So you make 2 of those 3 things legal you'd have most of that 500 million there to be had.The solution obviously is to make forms of CP that do not involve harming children not just legal, but subsidized by government.Loli and Shota artwork and similar does not involve molesting and hurting actual children, and yet, there's a huge, huge demand for it.It has been scientifically proven that cartoon children (drawn by adults) does not increase the likelyhood of future criminal activity, including but not limited to molesting children. I'll need to dig up the study one of these days, I'm sure Kotaku has a copy of it archived.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmBasics of supply and demand. For a transaction to happen, you have to have both. Making production illegal limits supply. But not doing anything about possession and distribution does NOT limit demand.Someone hasn't done their research on the history of prohibition, it seems.Making something illegal does nothing to change demand, sure, but it makes supply more risky, and more profitable.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmWhy not? Seriously, this is all econ 101. I encourage you take a macroeconomics class. This is elementary stuff. The financial incentives for CP would go through the roof if distribution and posession were legalized because 1) there would be no longer any risk to own and possess. 2) demand would go up as a result 3) increased demand would drive up the price 4)Wait, how would demand be effected at all?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmthe increased price from incresaed demand would mean supply (which is virtually nil for pay content right now) would rise in attempt to meet that demand. But the supply would be constrained by illegality, but would have the benefit of stealth technologies and distributors who are immune from prosecution, and consumers who were immunite too. Such a condition is ripe for the price to attain such a height that it would make it worth it for commercial production to get involved.That made no sense whatsoever.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmHuh? What are you TALKING about?That's what I want to know.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmA chunk of that payment goes into the pocket of the producer who then uses the cash to keep the business functioning and continuing to exploit children and produce CP. The payment is directly supported and promoting the production of CP. When CP is produced a child is molested. That's what CP is.Do you think Loli and Shota art counts as CP, then?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmDon't get what you're saying.What he is saying is that the production of child pornography, which involves the harm of children, has been outside the control of governments around the world for a very long time, and that prohibiting child pornography only harms people who are not actually involved in the harm of children.Two wrongs do not make a right, just saying.I do not like it when children are harmed, because children have the potential to become great people, kind people, people I talk to all of the time.However, the government is not any better than people that produce child pornography. The assumption that government are the good guys makes me want to laugh at people who imply it.Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmYou can't separate the demand for commercial CP from the production of commercial CP. One drives the other. Without the demand there's no production.You think making child pornography illegal is going to make demand disappear? You think that prohibition is effective?Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmThe real world does not live in the vacuum of PIR. That's why you couldn't make your metaphor work. There's no way to perfectly obfuscate demand in the real world. The demand for a product is half of what brings it to market, supply the other half. So we should round up all of those CP-lovers and kill them all for their thoughtcrime! That'll make it better!Quote from: jpinkman on January 26, 2013, 06:25 pmThe price is entirely dependent upon where the demand curve intersects the supply curve. With no price there's no product. So your metaphor couldn't possibly apply.\"With no price.\"Meaning that the price magically goes away when you make something punishable by law, huh?What a macaroon.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tAnd now for my promised citations. www.fd.org/pdf_lib/FJC2012/Child_Porn_Dangerousness.pdf by Melissa Hamilton, JD, Ph.Dsummary: Does not show an offender typology, but is still nice reading for any who wish to be informed. It shows the scientific flaws of various government studies involving CP, points out that the market thesis (jpinkmans argument) has absolutely zero empirical support, explains that teenagers are some of the biggest producers of child porn, traditional organized crime is not involved in child porn, child sex abuse rates have dropped 62% since the internet became mainstream (and CP became available again), child porn offenders and molesters are distinct groups with minor overlap, most CP offenders have large collections of adult porn as well (making them likely pornography addicts and/or sexually indiscriminate rather than pedophiles), technically a large percentage of males have interest in child porn, a popular government study into correlation between child porn possession and sexual contact with minors included sexual contact with minors when CP offender was under age (how honest of them!). Here is a typology from an FBI agent with 30 years of experience. It doesn't say the percentages though. Pornography addicts would likely fall under situational offender type a. QuotePreferential Offendersa .    pedophile: Offender, as previously discussed, with a definite preference forchildren.b.   Diverse offender: Offender with a wide variety of paraphiliac or deviant sexu-al interests, but no strong sexual preference for children. This offender waspreviously referred to in my typology as the sexually indiscriminate.c.     Latent offender: Individual with potentially illegal but previously latentsexual preferences who has more recently begun to criminally act outwhen inhibitions are weakened after arousal patterns are fueled and vali-dated through online computer communication.Situational offenders:a.    \"Normal” adolescent/adult: Usually a typical adolescent searching onlinefor pornography and sex or an impulsive/curious adult with newly foundaccess to a wide range of pornography and sexual opportunities.b.    Morally indiscriminate offender: Usually a power/anger-motivated sex of-fender with a history of varied violent offenses. Parents, especially mothers,who make their children available for sex with individuals on the Internetwould also most likely fit in this category.c.   Profiteer: The criminal just trying to make easy money. With the loweredrisk of identification and increased potential for profit, these individualshave returned to trafficking in child pornography.Miscellaneous “offenders:”a.    Media reporters: Individuals who erroneously believe they can go onlineand traffic in child pornography and arrange meetings with suspectedchild molesters as part of an authorized and valid news exposé.b.   Pranksters: Individuals who disseminate false or incriminating informa-tion to embarrass the targets of their “dirty tricks.”c.    Older “boyfriends:” Individuals in their late teens or early 20s attempting tosexually interact with adolescent girls or boys.d.   Overzealous citizens: Individuals who go overboard doing their own privateinvestigations into this problem. As will be discussed, investigators must becautious of all overzealous citizens offering their services in these cases.here is another info clip from here: http://www.nlada.org/forensics/for_lib/Documents/1170859257.66/nladasubmission.doc(note in particular that it says the frequently do not qualify for pedophilia)QuotePornography and importuning offenders are often a different ‘breed’ of sex offender. These offenders often do not have a prior sex offense history.  They rarely possess an antisocial personality  disorder and frequently do not qualify for pedophilia.  They may possess symptoms that fall under the rubric of the following categories:   Paraphilias (sexual deviancy disorders, i.e., pedophilia)   Hypersexual disorders   Obsessive compulsive disorders/Impulse Control Disorders   Online sexual problems/addictions   Other psychiatric disorders such as depression that include features of emotional loneliness and isolation or stem from environmental issues such as broken marriage and loss of employment. They may cope with these problems through inappropriate sexual activity.The most relevant paraphilic disorder concerning pornography offenders and importuners would be pedophilia. One must experience recurrent, intense sexually arousing fantasies, sexual urges, or behaviors involving sexual  activity with a prepubescent child or children, generally age 13 years or younger. All too often, a defendant is contacted by a law enforcement officer who imposters a 12 year old girl.  The age of 12 is usually used to fulfill two purposes: to establish an age relevant to pedophilia and also to satisfy harsher penalties under sex offender laws.  When considering this diagnosis, an expert should view all pornographic images to consider the ages of the children/adolescents as many of these pictures will be of teens older than age 13.  The expert must determine if the individual was viewing pornography for 6 months or longer. One can technically be diagnosed with pedophilia by viewing child pornography (and not actually engaging in hands-on offending of youth).  Such use must cause them impairment in social, occupational, or other areas of functioning.  Conversely, hypersexual disorders include a disturbance of more conventional sexual functioning such as masturbating or the use of pornography and at some point the use is compulsive and/or excessive and causes the person distress. Hypersexual disorders  may also include cybersex (Internet related activities geared for sexual arousal and attracting others online).  ....QuoteINTERNET ADDICTION & EMOTIONAL AVOIDANCEMany offenders who have possessed pornography on their computers and engaged in cyber-chat with underage females use the Internet to avoid negative emotional states, such as depression, anxiety, anger, boredom, and loneliness. Quayle, E., Vaughan, M., & Taylor, M. (2006). Sex offenders, Internet child abuse images and emotional avoidance: The importance of values. Aggression and Violent Behavior (11).  This is a critical point  because these offenders may not be sexually deviant, rather they use sex as an outlet to deal with these emotional deficits. The Internet serves as a device to access sexual material which ultimately assists in relieving one’s sexual arousal and alleviating emotional distress and dissatisfaction in one’s life.  The Internet offers sex offenders an avenue to download pornography and masturbate to images which is in effect a rewarding and reinforcing process leading to further avoidance from dealing with one’s problems and human relationships. Greenfield, D., & Orzack, M. (2002).  The Electronic Bedroom: Clinical Assessment of Online Sexual Problems and Internet-Enabled Sexual Behavior. In A. Cooper (Ed.), Sex and the Internet: A Guidebook for Clinicians (pp. 129-146).   This Internet behavior has an addictive quality with the subconscious process of avoiding negative emotional states.Internet addiction includes an individual who has obsessive thoughts about the Internet and has volitional problems controlling Internet use leading to excessive amounts of time online and failure to meet the demands of their everyday life.  They will likely experience negative emotional states when offline and increasing tolerance to the effects of being online while denying problematic behaviors in their lives.  When online, they will have more positive feelings about themselves. This Internet addiction includes a behavioral sequence that has a rewarding and reinforcing quality that mimics an impulse control disorder such as Kleptomania.  The images that stimulate sexual arousal, the anonymity with the computer use including anonymous chat rooms and typing on the computer, may play a role in making the Internet reinforcing.An important feature, the anonymity of the computer use which includes having relationships with others, is critical to many of these offenders, perhaps especially the importuners.  Importuning type offenders often lack relationships or are involved in dissatisfied and conflictual relationships/marriages and the chat rooms allow an outlet to have connections with others.  This connection with others which may be legal (exposing oneself through webcams to other consenting adults) may be reinforcing and have an addictive quality. The adult male who searches for consenting women to view his ‘show’ may have a difficult time finding these women online. He may be afraid that the  individuals he is exposing himself to are in fact homosexual men posing as women. His exposing activities which may not qualify for exhibitionism (because the viewers are not ‘unsuspecting strangers’)  may be reinforcing to him when he does find viewers he deems appropriate. However, given his emotional deficits and need for anonymous connection, this type of offender is often vulnerable to an instant sex connection with an online law enforcement agent who he thinks is an adolescent female.Importantly, one may question the differentiation of the behavioral reinforcement of the Internet use versus the function of the pornographic material itself. Quayle, E., & Taylor, M. (2002). Child pornography and the Internet: Perpetuating a cycle of abuse. Deviant Behavior: An Interdisciplinary Journal, 23.   Both resources serve the same purposes of obtaining reinforcing stimulation and avoiding negative mood and emotional states.  The Internet functions as an anonymous device to access both connections with others via chat rooms as well as a resource to obtain pornographic images to masturbate to.  Each behavioral sequence on the Internet serves as a motivation resulting in sexual arousal and orgasm which are pleasurable and intrinsically rewarding.   Pornography offenders are unlike contact ‘hands on’ sex offenders as the access to the Internet is available and immediate, controlled and anonymous.  The predator who society fears is the individual who stalks children and abducts them on playgrounds eventually sexually assaulting them, often in  a heinous fashion.  Indeed, most pornography offenders do not use pornography as a vehicle to stimulate themselves to engage in a contact sex offense. Well that is all I am going to post for now as I am having trouble to find any solid numbers in regards to the percentages of people arrested for CP crimes who qualify for a diagnosis of pedophilia versus pornography addiction. I know there is a pdf out there with such numbers though, as I recall reading it some years ago. I will continue looking and update this thread if I find it. Still I believe I have demonstrated citations proving that child pornography offenders fall somewhere on a wide typology that includes more than pedophiles, and additionally that they frequently do not qualify for pedophilia (as the last citation I give states). \n",

Your ruthless refusal so far to waver from ideology in order to spare even one child from sexual exploitation or religious brainwashing makes it rather clear you are more an anti-utilitarian that is opportunistically adopting the ostensible utilitarianism of this specious argument for less-than-utilitarian reasons. But as to your noble cause of wanting to save the \"unwittingly distributing\" dupes, you said yourself that LE is pretty good these days about distinguishing the unwitting from the intentional when deciding who and who not to pursue. So now you're claiming there are \"millions of unwitting distributors\" getting popped today? It doesn't sound as utilitarian as you're making it out to be because AFAICT, you're pulling these numbers out of your ass.To their slight favor, law enforcement appear to typically use some discretion in order to pursue targets that are more likely to commit crimes against children, and they are less likely to pursue minor offenders, however this is not always the case it is typically true. Their system of determining who to pursue uses a sliding scale that takes into account the extremity of the pornography (simple nudity to torture) the age of those in the photographs/videos (newborns to 17 year olds) the number of illegal items possessed (from 1 to millions) the level of networking the offender is involved in (from none to part of a closed membership security oriented group), the level of involvement the offender has with CP (from viewing without saving to production), and if there are any signs of the offender planning to engage in molestation. That said, with the rise of P2P distribution, law enforcement are much less able to distinguish between people who intended only to view some images and people who are distributors. This is because P2P software generally shares all downloaded content, and the person who would have once been a low priority target for having viewed a dozen CP images, now becomes a much higher priority target for continuously sharing a dozen CP images from his IP address. I do not have exact numbers, but I can imagine that a great many of the millions of people sharing CP on public P2P networks, never intended to be CP distributors but rather only intended to be CP possessors. This has some amount of evidence backing it, it is quite typical for those arrested for distribution to claim that they were unaware their P2P software had made the images available. This is particularly troubling, as the amount of effort LE puts into apprehending CP possessors is much much less than the amount of effort they put into apprehending CP distributors. QuoteWhat is little or temporary about protecting kids from sexual exploitation?Correct me if I’m wrong but what I hear you saying then is that you now believe the purchase or distribution of child porn from its producer (as opposed to repackaged content) should be illegal but you have no way of enforcing that illegality since there would be no good way to determine whether a distributor is knew the producer?If it can be proven that a distributor has paid for a child to be molested, then I believe that they should be treated as criminals. If it cannot be proven though, I am not convinced that they have done anything that should be treated as criminal. There is a massive difference between paying for a child to be molested and paying for recycled images from ten or twenty years ago. Ignoring this difference, at the cost of the liberties of those who are paying for old images, in order to be better able to combat those who actually are paying for children to be molested, is sacrificing liberty for security. QuoteSo just think of the mountain of cash they would have made had they been producing fresh quality content instead of recycling.I think they would have made almost exactly as much.QuoteOpen source developers code it for free for the prestige, bragging rights, and to bolster their professional pedigrees. There are indirect but real financial rewards from raising their profile this way. A lot of CP is produced for bragging rights in CP trading communities. QuoteThey have the need and skillz. Amateur child porn producers do it for sick thrills and voyeuristic and exhibitionary reasons. They’re not all about raising the profiles for bragging rights unless they’re looking to get popped and take themselves out of the gameAlthough all of what you have said is true, they also do frequently do it for bragging rights in their own communities. One of the biggest reasons they do it is to be given membership to producer only groups.Quote. They’re not doing it to improve the financial rewards in their professional life. And the average amateur producer will have neither the time, resources, nor skillz to produce high end content. The small percentage of them who do have the time, resources, and skillz are have no incentive to get in the game of producing high end content right now. Why? Because the risks are too high and the return of investment too low as there are no easy ways to monetize the return on their high end content. There’s huge demand for drugs through the mail too, you don’t think vendors would stop vending on SR should bitcoin become defunct even though enormous demand would remain? Of course they would. The inability to monetize demand makes it not worth the expense for businesses. Simple economics. Costs exceed benefits. People were vending drugs online years before Bitcoin was created. A lot of people use western union with fake ID to take payment to this very day. \n",

      "QuoteI don’t see how you can call marked increases to the bottom line through sales “speculative” demand. Looks like a tangible increase in demand to me. And since we are discussing commercialization, I still don’t see the use of this metaphor. I’m against legalizing possession and distribution because of the harm it incurs. If these acts happened in a vacuum that made it impossible to harm anyone else I wouldn’t be. If it didn't harm anyone sexual attraction to prepubescent children could just be another sexual fetish, a sexual preference even, and I wouldn't give two shits about what pedophiles did. But it’s not useful to speculate on that because facts don’t exist independently in vacuums IRL. And we are talking about child porn and not widgets in a mental masurbatory math exercise.You would charge for access to a PIR system that holds many things including CP. Since the payment is for access to the system, and the content downloaded from the system cannot be determined by anyone, it thus masks the demand for the content both from a financial perspective and also from the perspective of nobody knows that the content is actually downloaded. Child porn essentially is a widget in a math exercise, just as all other data represented with 1's and 0's is. QuoteFurthermore, knowledge of the heavy psychological damage incurred upon victims of child sex abuse has only become prominent over the last 30 years or so with awareness spreading gradually during that time around the globe. It's why massive underage sex scandals could even come to light at all against religious orgs as powerful as the Catholic Church. It's why pedos like Gary Glitter can find no safe refuge in the world where he can safely practice his desire of underage sex, while serial child sex abuser Jimmy Saville could go to town on hoards of children and have it all complicitously hushed up by mobs of enablers back in the seventies. Sure child sex abuse causes horribly psychological damage to the victims of it. However I am entirely unconvinced that there is a magical voodoo revictimization process that somehow instantaneously occurs when someone looks at CP. A CP file is just a bunch of 1's and 0's when you get down to it, looking at how a particular series of 1's and 0's causes pixels on your monitor to color themselves does not have a magical effect on the subjects portrayed in the images. QuoteAlthough I’m not familiar with the numbers you admitted yourself there are large numbers doing this unwittingly who have no idea CP is mingled in with the jailbait porn they are downloading. I am familiar with the numbers. There are tens of millions of people on P2P networks intentionally seeking out and downloading very underage CP, often unwittingly becoming distributors in doing so. There are also a lot of people who unwittingly download jailbait porn, which actually is considered to be CP, from many clearnet porn sites that allow user uploadable content.   And there are some cases where prepubescent porn makes its way to such sites as well, although on mainstream porn sites you will be much less likely to find content like this than to find jailbait porn. CP is quite the epidemic at this point in time, the number of people becoming involved with it is growing at an extremely rapid rate that shows no signs of slowing down. And it is largely not child molesters but simply curious idiots on P2P networks who don't realize how easy it is for them to be caught, or that after viewing some images they will automatically start distributing them. That is really the saddest part about CP laws, the fact that a great many good and normal people are finding themselves facing many years in prison and lifetimes as registered sex offenders for finding some image or video from a P2P network search (perhaps not even a search for CP), downloading it out of curiosity and unwittingly becoming a distributor of child pornography. It is the most unfair and cruel fate for these people to have their entire lives completely and thoroughly ruined for downloading a bunch of 1's and 0's. I am grateful that federal judges particularly are starting to speak out about the cruelty of child pornography laws, as well as some other small parts of the legal system. But there is so much misinformation in peoples heads, so many bullshit government studies with falsified statistics, so much misinformation and fear mongering and term merging from the media and so many political points to be won for being hard on CP offenders, that countless more people are going to be fucked by these laws for many more years before anything significantly changes. And really it is insane that even if someone faces only a maximum of five years in  prison for having a CP image, they quickly can go away for life once they have twenty images. They are almost entirely at the mercy of the courts in regards to if they will die in prison or be released on probation, and it has gone either way in cases that are otherwise essentially the same. Where is the justice in that? I would like to point out that the people arguing against reduced sentences for CP possession in the following article, are citing LIES and FALSIFIED STUDIES. They are either misled by propaganda or they themselves are continuing to intentionally spread lies and propaganda. As the citation I gave above shows, one of their primary studies that showed 85% of CP offenders had had sexual contact with a child, INCLUDED SEXUAL CONTACT WHEN THE OFFENDER WAS A MINOR. That is like saying we should have strict sentences for having yellow as your favorite color, because 85% of people who have yellow as their favorite color had sex with one of their peers when they were in highschool! It is god damn shameful that we have people in authority positions making such bullshit studies (they were probably trained by the people \"studying\" drugs) and it is a god damn shame that the media and politicians regurgitate these lies so much that they enter into the minds of the public as truth. It is a sham, they try to demonize people so they can get them sent to prisons and rehabilitation facilities and on probation, so that they can fund themselves with more and more money, fund their private industry partners (a lot of private industry involvement in making tools for tracking down CP offenders, it is a multi billion dollar industry for fucks sake!), gain political points, etc. They are literally selling harmless, normal people into a lifetime of fucking slavery, people who go to prison for CP offenses are just as much slaves to the state as people who go to prison for drug offenses, the dirty tactics used by the state to turn society rabidly against these people are the same dirty tactics they use to turn society against drug users. It is a farce and it is a fucking shame. http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/04/29/debate-rages-over-severity-child-porn-sentences/QuoteNEW YORK –  Their crimes are so loathsome that some hardened courtroom veterans recoil at viewing the evidence. Yet child-pornography offenders are now the focus of an intense debate within the legal community as to whether the federal sentences they face have become, in many cases, too severe.By the end of this year, after a review dating to 2009, the U.S. Sentencing Commission plans to release a report that's likely to propose changes to the sentencing guidelines that it oversees. It's a daunting task, given the polarized viewpoints that the commission is weighing.The issue \"is highly charged, both emotionally and politically,\" said one of the six commissioners, U.S. District Judge Beryl Howell.On one side of the debate, many federal judges and public defenders say repeated moves by Congress to toughen the penalties over the past 25 years have badly skewed the guidelines, to the point where offenders who possess and distribute child pornography can go to prison for longer than those who actually rape or sexually abuse a child. In a 2010 survey of federal judges by the Sentencing Commission, about 70 percent said the proposed ranges of sentences for possession and receipt of child pornography were too high. Demonstrating their displeasure, federal judges issued child porn sentences below the guidelines 45 percent of the time in 2010, more than double the rate for all other crimes.On the other hand, some prosecutors and members of Congress, as well as advocates for sexual-abuse victims, oppose any push for more leniency. At a public hearing in February, the Sentencing Commission received a victim's statement lamenting that child pornography offenders \"are being entertained by my shame and pain.\"\"They need to be taught how much pain they inflict and a greater term of imprisonment will teach them that, (and) will comfort victims seeking justice,\" the victim said. \"I don't believe that short periods of imprisonment will accomplish these things.\"Once completed, the Sentencing Commission report will be submitted to Congress, which could shelve it or incorporate its recommendations into new legislation.Already, the commission has conveyed some concerns. In a 2010 report on mandatory minimum sentences, the commission said the penalties for certain child pornography offenses \"may be excessively severe and as a result are being applied inconsistently.\"However, similar misgivings voiced by the commission in previous years failed to deter Congress from repeatedly ratcheting up the penalties — including legislation in 2003 that more than doubled average sentences for child pornography crimes.Many of the offenses carry a mandatory minimum sentence of five years in prison, and the guidelines call for additional penalties — known as enhancements — based on a range of factors, such as the age of the children depicted in the imagery and whether a computer was used in the crime. As of last year, the median sentence was seven years.In a recent article for the journal of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers, former Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania and former federal prosecutor Linda Dale Hoffa criticized the approach by Congress.\"The fact that child pornography offenders can be given longer sentences than child abusers or violent offenders reflects a lack of care by Congress,\" Specter and Hoffa wrote. \"In the rush to prove itself hostile to individuals who possess or distribute child pornography, Congress has obscured the real distinctions between different offenders.\"Hoffa doubts Congress will be eager to ease the guidelines.\"If you vote against these harsher penalties, the sound bite is that you're protecting child pornographers, and that could be the end of somebody's career,\" she said in a telephone interview. \"It's a political radioactive hot potato.\"As a backdrop to the sentencing debate, Internet-based child pornography has proliferated, and the crime is an increasingly high priority for federal law enforcement agents.According to the Justice Department, federal prosecutors obtained at least 2,713 indictments for sexual exploitation of minors in 2011, up from 1,901 in 2006. This month, the FBI announced that the latest addition to its \"Ten Most Wanted Fugitives\" is a former elementary school teacher, Eric Justin Toth, who is accused of possessing and producing child pornography.In testimony to the Sentencing Commission in February, three Justice Department experts said the sentencing guidelines for child pornography should be revised — not with the overall aim of making them more lenient, but rather to help the courts do a better job of differentiating among offenders and determining appropriate punishment.\"The guideline has not kept pace with technological advancements in both computer media and Internet and software technologies,\" the DOJ experts said.As opposed to focusing on the quantity of images collected by an offender, the experts said revised guidelines could take into account the length of time the offender has been involved with child porn, the degree of sophistication of measures taken to avoid detection, and the extent to which the offender communicates as part of a network.One such network, called Dreamboard, was unraveled by investigators last year. In all, 72 people were charged with participating in an international, members-only Internet club created to trade tens of thousands of images and videos of sexually abused children.There's one point of agreement in the sentencing debate: All parties agree that penalties should remain severe — or be toughened — for those who produce and promote child pornography.A key point of contention, by contrast, is the degree to which offenders charged with receipt and possession of child porn pose a risk of physically abusing children themselves, as opposed to looking at images of abuse.New York-based federal defender Deirdre von Dornum told the Sentencing Commission there's insufficient evidence to prove a strong correlation. Child pornography offenders have a lower recidivism rate than child molesters, she said, and many could be safely monitored via supervised probation.\"Many of these individuals have stable employment, family support, and no prior contact with the criminal justice system,\" she said. \"Punitive terms of imprisonment do nothing but weaken or destroy pro-social influences in their lives.\"The Justice Department experts were more skeptical, citing research suggesting that a substantial percentage of child-pornography offenders are pedophiles who either have sexually abused a child or might try to do so.Von Dornum challenged the premise that tough sentencing would dry up the market for child porn.\"Because child pornography is free, widely available and easy to produce, it is not subject to the normal laws of supply and demand,\" she said, noting that many countries do not even have laws against it.She also said the sentencing guidelines contribute to unjust disparities, depending on whether a prosecutor charged a defendant with receipt of child pornography, as well as possession. Under the guidelines, receipt carries a five-year mandatory minimum sentence, but possession has no mandatory minimum.According to von Dornum, the average sentence for a federal child pornography offense in 2010 was higher than for all other offenses except murder and kidnapping. Indeed, the average was about six months higher than for sexual abuse offenders.\"Yet there is significant political pressure to do nothing but continue to increase penalties for these offenders, the 'modern-day untouchables,'\" she testified. She urged the commission \"to take the difficult step of rising above the politics and fear\" and revise the sentencing framework.Another witness at the February hearing — testifying on behalf of her fellow federal judges in the Judicial Conference of the United States — was Casey Rodgers, chief judge of the Northern District of Florida.Rodgers stressed that child pornography entails \"unspeakable acts by the offenders and unimaginable harm to the child victims.\"Nonetheless, she said doubts are growing within the judiciary about the reasonableness of the sentencing guidelines, as demonstrated by the extent to which judges are refusing to follow them and issuing lower sentences.Rodgers urged the commission to propose repealing the mandatory minimum sentence for receipt of child porn. And she said the guidelines should be revised to help judges better identify which offenders are at greatest risk of committing future sexual abuse of children.\"Lengthy terms of incarceration alone will not adequately address the harms of these offenders,\" she testified. \"Greater reliance on the use of supervised release should be considered.\"Troy Stabenow, an assistant federal public defender in Missouri, said the judges' resistance to the sentencing guidelines was \"pretty courageous,\"\"They're doing it knowing they're likely be lambasted in the media,\" he said. \"They wouldn't be doing it unless they really believe a lot of typical offenders they see are not the menace that people assume they are.\"In Congress, some Republicans have voiced dismay at the judges' stance, as evidenced by a recent letter to the Sentencing Commission from Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, R-Wis., chairman of the House Subcommittee on Crime.\"I am concerned that the federal judiciary is failing to consider the severity of child pornography and its victims,\" he wrote. \"This departure rate is disturbing and threatens the most vulnerable among us, our children.\"Among Democrats in Congress, there are numerous critics of mandatory minimum sentences — for example, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt. But members of Leahy's staff doubt there will be any groundswell of support in Congress for easing child-pornography sentences.One of the few recent rollbacks of sentencing laws came in 2010 when Congress reduced the difference between sentences for crimes committed by crack cocaine and powder cocaine users.The disparity had been assailed by civil-rights advocates as a form of racial discrimination because most people convicted of crack crimes were black.There's no equivalent advocacy campaign on behalf of child porn offenders, about 90 percent of whom are white.\"You don't have any built-in sympathy,\" said Jelani Jefferson Exum, a professor at the University of Toledo College of Law. \"Who's going to stand up and say, 'I'm fighting for child porn possessors.'\"Susan Howley, public policy director for the National Center for Victims of Crime, has been urging those involved in the debate to keep the victims in mind. She says they face higher risk of developing mental health disorders, sexual dysfunction and substance abuse problems.\"While sentencing does not appear to be the perfect tool to reduce the market for child abuse images, it is one of the few tools available,\" Howley told the public hearing in February. \"Through sentencing we express to society, and to the individual victims and family members harmed, that we recognize the seriousness of this offense.\"\n",

Their system of determining who to pursue uses a sliding scale that takes into account the extremity of the pornography (simple nudity to torture) the age of those in the photographs/videos (newborns to 17 year olds) the number of illegal items possessed (from 1 to millions) the level of networking the offender is involved in (from none to part of a closed membership security oriented group), the level of involvement the offender has with CP (from viewing without saving to production), and if there are any signs of the offender planning to engage in molestation. That said, with the rise of P2P distribution, law enforcement are much less able to distinguish between people who intended only to view some images and people who are distributors. This is because P2P software generally shares all downloaded content, and the person who would have once been a low priority target for having viewed a dozen CP images, now becomes a much higher priority target for continuously sharing a dozen CP images from his IP address. I do not have exact numbers, but I can imagine that a great many of the millions of people sharing CP on public P2P networks, never intended to be CP distributors but rather only intended to be CP possessors. This has some amount of evidence backing it, it is quite typical for those arrested for distribution to claim that they were unaware their P2P software had made the images available. This is particularly troubling, as the amount of effort LE puts into apprehending CP possessors is much much less than the amount of effort they put into apprehending CP distributors. QuoteWhat is little or temporary about protecting kids from sexual exploitation?Correct me if I’m wrong but what I hear you saying then is that you now believe the purchase or distribution of child porn from its producer (as opposed to repackaged content) should be illegal but you have no way of enforcing that illegality since there would be no good way to determine whether a distributor is knew the producer?If it can be proven that a distributor has paid for a child to be molested, then I believe that they should be treated as criminals. If it cannot be proven though, I am not convinced that they have done anything that should be treated as criminal. There is a massive difference between paying for a child to be molested and paying for recycled images from ten or twenty years ago. Ignoring this difference, at the cost of the liberties of those who are paying for old images, in order to be better able to combat those who actually are paying for children to be molested, is sacrificing liberty for security.

Because the risks are too high and the return of investment too low as there are no easy ways to monetize the return on their high end content.

If the parents had brainwashed their kids to become willing, complicit, and consensual sex slaves and incorporated it into their religious dogma it would be ok with you?I believe that at some ages a child is incapable of giving consent to sexual activity and thus at these ages it is justified for us to intervene in preventing them from being taken advantage of by their family members and/or others. Who is \"us\"? For whom is it justified for \"us\" to intervene? Who would be responsible for the children of such a sex cult? Why should \"we\" care? They are someone else's kids.Quote from: kmfkewm on February 02, 2013, 05:35 amQuoteHere’s the rub. When you talk about militant libertarianism seizing and governing a society by force, it’s not enough to sit around passively saying you do or do not claim something. Policy would be built on these ideas that you do or do not claim which would be followed by real world effects. So the question is whether you believe parents own their children. And the answer has to be definitive as it’s not enough to say that “you do not claim that parents own their children” because you’re the one proposing to run a society by your ideals so you really should start making claims instead of trying to dodge these sorts of big picture questions by only stating what you do not claim. You either claim parents own their children or claim they do not and if the latter you should be willing to stop parents doing this with force if necessary or else what’s the point of making such a claim? I do not believe that parents own their children. I do believe that parents have a responsibility to provide to their children up to a certain point and age. I do believe that a child is free to leave his parents if he so desires, and to obtain resources and education in any way he is capable of doing. Primarily I do not think that I own the children of others, and thus I do not believe I have the right to force them to learn the things that I strongly believe to be correct.What age would this be? 11? 14? 20? Why do you choose that age? Is there any rhyme or reason to that particular age? Is it because your country says that is the \"Age of Reason\"? Does the legal \"Age of Consent\" in your country have any bearing on reality whatsoever?So do all children on the planet fall under your responsibility?What if the colonists of Mars decided to \"initiate\" their children into a \"Sex cult\" at the age of 12. Would that also be relevant to your society?If so, if that is your business, then would you be willing to wage a war of extermination to wipe out that entire culture, possibly killing many of those children in the process?What would that accomplish?Quote from: kmfkewm on February 02, 2013, 05:35 amQuoteBecause really, I'm still have the hardest time wrapping my head around what this militant libertarian silliness would look like in actuality. No government. Just roving packs of armed-to-the-teeth militant libertarian vigilantes going around like a gang of thugs enforcing private law with brute force against those they suspect of violating the law as arbitrarily decreed by their employer. Judge, jury, and likely executioners too all wrapped up into one uber administrator of justice y0h? Just think of how much dough would be saved for not having to spend a dime on due process in this world where everyone is \"free\". Oh yeah, but that's not public money going to a public court again. The dime is being saved by the mini-despot who owns the property and goes instead to his private pinkerton army to enforce his law. The price of freedom y0h.Essentially there would be private defense agencies. These agencies would be funded solely by their customers. They would have lists of things that they would be willing to enforce. It would be similar to insurance in a way. If your home is burglarized, they may agree to reimburse you for your losses provided that you transfer to them the right to collect from the criminal. Then they will be motivated to find the criminal to recoup on the losses they sustained by reimbursing you. After apprehending the person they believe to be the burglar, they would need to consult with his defense agency as well. A process for determining guilt would need to be agreed upon between the two agencies. If the burglars defense agency is unwilling to do this, then force would likely have to be used against their client and/or them (depending on if they resist the force used against their client). The primary goal of the defense agency is to recover the profit loss of reimbursing their customer and apprehending the criminal, and it is likely that they will forfeit the criminals assets in order to do this. The exact amount of asset forfeiture will be determined by agreement between the two private defense agencies, likely with contractual bindings as well (for example, the criminals defense agency is unlikely to tolerate a death penalty for the stealing of a candy bar). In cases where the criminal has no defense agency, he will be more at the mercy of the defense agency accusing him of theft. However, it will not be in this defense agencies best interests to pay for his long term incarceration, as that will cost them money for no benefit. Also, it is not in their best interests to execute him, as an organization that executes people for relatively minor crimes will come to be seen as a threat by other defense agencies, and preemptively incapacitated. Some private defense agencies will be corporations, and would have to be pretty large to defend themselves.What do you think about mutualist cooperatives?A cooperative defense agency would actually be pretty competitive in such a market, wouldn't you think?Quote from: kmfkewm on February 02, 2013, 05:35 amOne of the best benefits of having private defense agencies rather than public banditry agencies, is that victimless crimes will soon become impossible to enforce. Nobody in their right mind  is going to agree to fund things such as the war on drugs, it would be of absolutely no advantage to them. Now there will still be criminal organizations such as the DEA, who try to make their livings by robbing and possibly even enslaving drug users, but they will be seen as the criminals that they are, and they will have to go up against the private defense agencies protecting the drug dealers. Additionally, even if a drug dealer has no private defense agency representing him, it is in the best interests of all drug dealers in the criminal bandits of the DEA are preemptively incapacitated.I'd love to see the DEA treated like the criminal bandits they really are. Quote from: kmfkewm on February 02, 2013, 05:35 amQuoteTrust me when I say I would never accuse you of being utilitarian. Your ruthless refusal so far to waver from ideology in order to spare even one child from sexual exploitation or religious brainwashing makes it rather clear you are more an anti-utilitarian that is opportunistically adopting the ostensible utilitarianism of this specious argument for less-than-utilitarian reasons. But as to your noble cause of wanting to save the \"unwittingly distributing\" dupes, you said yourself that LE is pretty good these days about distinguishing the unwitting from the intentional when deciding who and who not to pursue.

Although I think most of us in this thread can agree that harming children is reprehensible, the question, I think, is where does the responsibility to correct the situation lie?If I saw a human child being harmed, I would not ignore it. However, I have seen several times the mention of groups of enforces to protect children even from their own parents.I was abused as a child, so I can understand the necessity. The problem is how would we construct such an enforcement system?What happens to the children once they have been \"liberated\" from their parents, who were molesting and exploiting them?It's all well and good to throw out an obviously corrupted system, but quite another to replace it with a superior system.Quote from: kmfkewm on February 02, 2013, 05:35 amQuoteWhat is little or temporary about protecting kids from sexual exploitation?Correct me if I’m wrong but what I hear you saying then is that you now believe the purchase or distribution of child porn from its producer (as opposed to repackaged content) should be illegal but you have no way of enforcing that illegality since there would be no good way to determine whether a distributor is knew the producer?If it can be proven that a distributor has paid for a child to be molested, then I believe that they should be treated as criminals.

What system would you design and build to replace this one?Where is the line drawn?I like the idea about private defense agencies, because that's an idea that would lead to a very civilized society.That also means that even the youngest genius would be able to defend himself, since it's money, not age, that determines membership with a private defense agency.Say my son is 12 years old, and has made some money, and I die. Rather than be shuttled off to some church to be put up for adoption, he could use the life insurance payment upon my death to roll over my contract with the family private defense agency.

They are someone else's kids.What I mean by us, is that if someone is raping their infant, I would be willing to contribute to a fund that hires a defense agency to act on the infants behalf in preventing their parents from continuing. If someone is screwing willing fourteen year old's , I would not spend money to try to stop them. That said you do not need to care about the infant, I do not think that you should be forced to defend the infant. I also doubt you will spend money to try to counter those who do spend money / resources in a bid to help the infant. I also doubt that you would support a defense agency that attempts to protect people who rape their infants from attack, and indeed I think that a lot of people would preemptively attack such an agency. QuoteWhat age would this be? 11? 14? 20? Why do you choose that age? Is there any rhyme or reason to that particular age? Is it because your country says that is the \"Age of Reason\"? Does the legal \"Age of Consent\" in your country have any bearing on reality whatsoever?So do all children on the planet fall under your responsibility?I do not think that there is a set age perhaps. I think it does depend to some extent on what people with resources have to say, so far as enforceability goes anyway. Even though it is morally contemptible for a person to rape infants, if nobody wants to spend resources on preventing infants from being raped, then it will not matter from an enforceability point of view. From a moralistic point of view, I certainly do not think that it is moral for someone to have sexual relations with prepubescents, and the younger the child is the more immoral I see their behavior to be. I am in favor of a fairly young age of consent, perhaps 14. I wouldn't spend any money to incapacitate people who have sex with people who are 14 or older anyway. I probably wouldn't even spend money to stop people who have sex with 13 year old's honestly, if I found this to be particularly abhorrent behavior I would probably be campaigning in Spain for them to raise their age of consent past 13, and I do not envision myself going to war with Spain even if militant libertarianism catches on. I do not believe any country has an age of consent below 12, so it seems that most people in the world agree that sexual relations with people under 12 are immoral and should be illegal. No the legal age of consent in my country has absolutely no mapping to reality. Some parts of my country have an age of consent that is higher than almost anywhere else in the entire world, save Madagascar where the age of consent is 21, and some countries that place 21 age of consent for homosexual but not for heterosexual relationships. One of the funniest things I find with USA is that in some parts of it the age of consent is 16, which is the minimum allowed age of consent by federal law. So it is legal to have sex with 16 year old's, but a felony to have pictures of flashing 16 year old girls. That makes absolutely no sense to me.That said it is not my responsibility to take care of any children other than any children of my own. But nothing prevents me from spending resources on trying to prevent people from raping their infants. QuoteIf so, if that is your business, then would you be willing to wage a war of extermination to wipe out that entire culture, possibly killing many of those children in the process?I would likely contribute to an agency that attempts to prevent people from raping their children.QuoteSome private defense agencies will be corporations, and would have to be pretty large to defend themselves.What do you think about mutualist cooperatives?A cooperative defense agency would actually be pretty competitive in such a market, wouldn't you think?I do think that there would be large networks of defense agencies with similar beliefs. I also think there will be agencies that attempt to enforce the laws of today, it is quite likely that the DEA will continue in their mission of robbing drug dealers for example. I think that there will be war between these agencies, and eventually one network of agencies will defeat the networks which hold ideologies that are mutually exclusive with the victors ideologies. For example, there cannot be a communist \"defense\" agency that holds the ideology that property ownership if theft, while there is a libertarian private defense agency that holds that coercive wealth redistribution is theft, without a war erupting. The communist defense agency will be funded by people who hold to the communist ideology, they will likely rob people and then redistribute their money. The libertarian defense agency will be funded by libertarians, they will try to prevent the communist agency from stealing money from their clients, as well as attempt to eradicate the communist agency to preemptively protect their clients. Eventually one of these agencies will need to use force to overcome the other. I think that these agencies will be highly decentralized and distributing, operating on a global scale and of course they will not operate under the flag of any state. Some of them, like the communists, will steal for part of their funding, whereas others, such as the libertarians, will be supported entirely by the free market.

The world is a large place and it would be foolish for me to think that there will not be thousands of people in it who are willing to pay for CP. I still maintain that they should not be treated as criminal unless it can be proven that they have knowingly and directly funded a child molester for the purpose of producing new child pornography. I also still maintain that with the rise of P2P, commercial CP distribution is going to be less valuable to those interested in obtaining CP.Thinking about this issue a little more, it's hard for me not to conclude that the commercial viability of repackaged old kiddie porn was in many ways driven by a lack of new content. Again I point to the adult model. There's just no way discerning porn buyers are going to be paying for repackaged old content. None. It's just ludicrous unless they were duped into it by false advertising. So again, it's hard for me to believe the example you provided tells us anything about how things would be should distribution and possession be legalized. Would those thousands of members been paying a hundred bucks for membership to the site you mentioned if their money could have gone to a site that was creating new content? Fuck no.QuoteI do not think that religious indoctrination is an abuse of such magnitude that it would justify external intervention. Even today there are groups that largely indoctrinate their children and cut off their access to external information, the Amish is one such population, however I do not believe that we must force the Amish to modernize themselves or to teach their children things that are at odds with their traditional faith. Does that mean that you now suspect me of being a closeted Amish person? Since the Amish forsake technology and modern conveniences and don't educate themselves past 8th grade, no I don't believe you're a closeted Amish or any sort of neo-luddite of that nature.I'll just point out that in your world of no government it would really be up to the private school owner whether a student could opt out of a class because of the religious objections of the parent. Any secular minded owner might see for themselves the downside of degrading education standards and the level of education from their graduating students and refuse. The dogmatically religious not in the vicinity of a religious school that spurns scientific education would have to educate their child likewise else not at all, since in a purely privatized world property rights would trump all.QuoteYeah you did vastly overestimate the probability of the Christian beliefs mapping to reality, it approaches zero so closely that I could fill the screen up with zeros prior to putting a 1. It seems we do not disagree on this, rather we disagree on if we have the right to force others to teach their children the things that have the highest probability of being true or not. Ok. So here's a thought experiment for you. Instead of 99.99999999999-whatever it were 100%. Would that make any difference in whether you'd feel justified to use force? If not, why did you even use that totally specious argument earlier about how you don't feel you can use force when you don't know for sure?QuoteCertainly it has come to light on rare occasions, however you are naive to think that schools do not routinely expose the children they teach to religion. I have had teachers at public schools who knew of my lack of faith tell me that they think it is insane I risk my eternal soul. Indeed, I had one tell me while looking down his nose at me, that it is \"too bad\" that I am not a Christian. Although they did not try to teach me intelligent design. I cannot recall if in our daily pledge of allegiance to the state if we said \"one nation under God\", but I assume that we did as it is part of the pledge.  Absurd. You seem to have a hard time distinguishing between the actions of rogue individuals, in this case a teacher trying to pressure proselytize to you in spite of that being strictly prohibited in a public school, and public education policy. There's nothing preventing what you just described from happening to you at a secular private school in your militant libertarian world. You're really gullible in thinking your world will just run perfectly without people breaking the rules of negotiated contracts. Like I was saying, the separation of church and state was a founding principle and bedrock of the constitution and public schools are in no danger of introducing religion into course curriculum as part of public policy.  QuoteAlso, the founders made no mentions of Ak-47s either, but it is widely believed that we have the constitutional right to own these weapons. Likewise the constitution promises us freedom of speech and of the press. Admittedly there have been restrictions placed on freedom of speech, as well as the firearms that we are allowed to own. It makes sense that we cannot falsely yell fire in a crowded room, at least it makes sense so long as we live in a society that doesn't respect the rights of property owners enough to let them decide the rules of their own property. The courts have held that freedom of speech can be violated when there is a compelling reason to do so, with a clear societal benefit in doing so.You missed my point completely. Separation of Church and state enjoys an invioblility on a level that the 1st and 2nd amendment and their exceptions do not. There are no exceptions. What you keep confusing is the actions of rogue teachers or groups imposing their beliefs on a school or district unconstitutionally. The fact that they get shut down demonstrates the inviobility of this separation.QuoteI would maintain that this is not the case for child pornography possession in particular, as numerous studies have shown that there is no true correlation between child pornography possession and sex crimes against children. I would also extend this to distribution, although of course not production short of non coerced self production. In fact I would argue that there is a compelling reason with a clear societal benefit in legalizing the possession and distribution of child pornography, as numerous studies have concluded that the access to child pornography in an area strongly negatively correlates with the rate of child sex abuse in said area. Thus the courts ban of child pornography possession not only does not meet the criteria required for restricting our right to freedom of speech, but it actually does the exact opposite of what they intended. This is what happens when uninformed and emotionally charged people are given power, they make decisions that seem to be correct to them but are incorrect due to their lack of knowledge and inability to reason.Haven't read through the study yet though it looks interesting, thanks for digging that up. I've already made my position clear though that I never claimed child porn acts as a catalyst for pedos to go out and rape. I've been pointing out since my OP that by legalizing distribution and possession the incresaed demand and distribution channels ready to monetize demand will increase incentives for commercial CP will become a reality.QuoteAdditionally our constitutional right to freedom of and from religion is also routinely violated. People in the church of Santo Daime are given an exception to the controlled substance act that allows them to consume DMT, Native Americans of certain religious backgrounds are given exceptions to the controlled substance act allowing them to use mescaline and additionally Catholic children are given exceptions to alcohol laws in order for them to be allowed to take their communion. These are all clear violations of the constitution. In short, essentially every single part of the constitution has been and continues to be violated by the government.Wait, I'm not following why you think the examples you provided are violations of the constitution. To me they appear to be upholding the freedom to practice one's religion. Since these drugs are part of religious practice, they are condoned even though there are laws on the books that prohibit them.QuoteIt is essentially a worthless document and it is used more for propaganda and as a political talking point than anything.Used as propaganda and a political talking point? Yes. Worthless document? Whatever. QuoteNone of the major political parties in the United States actually want to follow the constitution, and they don't. Libertarians are the only ones who actually like the majority of the constitution of the USA.This is purely your opinion. Do you realize that there are multiple ways to interpret the constitution?

QuoteNow there will still be criminal organizations such as the DEA, who try to make their livings by robbing and possibly even enslaving drug users, but they will be seen as the criminals that they are, and they will have to go up against the private defense agencies protecting the drug dealers.Not really sure what would distinguish any of these private armies from the DEA really. They all would be serving the private interests of the few so they wouldn't be standing up for the general interest of the public. But you somehow think they would stand up to a DEA militia because they are robbing and enslaving drug users. LMAO! Well Game Theory tells us that's simply nonsense. They'd sooner come to an agreement with the DEA militia that they can do whatever the fuck they want so long as they don't try to rob and enslave the drug users amongst the private army owners and their associates. No one with a private army and private interests to protect is going to go to war over the rights of drug users outside of their own. The losers, as usual, would be those that can't afford private armies to defend themselves. A DEA militia will have no incentive to go to war against private armies when they can negotiate a kickback from wealthy drug users and mop up the rest.QuoteAdditionally, even if a drug dealer has no private defense agency representing him, it is in the best interests of all drug dealers in the criminal bandits of the DEA are preemptively incapacitated.Again wishful thinking. Drug dealers without private armies would be nothing. Riff raff and totally inconsequential to everyone, to be extorted and abused by cartels and DEA alike. Drug dealing cartels that had private armies would just see the DEA as another cartel attempting to intrude on their turf. Meanwhile they would negotiate terms with the DEA as I explained already. There's no reason to see the DEA as more of a threat than any other competing cartel pursuing wealth and power. The DEA ideology might be different. But in practice there would be nothing separating them that would make it any more likely for cartels to set aside their differences to smash the DEA than one to work with the DEA to smash a competing cartel.QuoteThere is a massive difference between paying for a child to be molested and paying for recycled images from ten or twenty years ago.

A lot of people use western union with fake ID to take payment to this very day. You completely missed my point again by getting bogged down in the details. So let me paste what my point of that paragraph was:\"The small percentage of them who do have the time, resources, and skillz have no incentive to get in the game of producing high end content right now. Why? Because the risks are too high and the return on investment too low as there are no easy ways to monetize the return on their high end content.\"The free kiddie porn industry is not going to start producing high end content like the open source model has developed high end software like linux. Not going to happen. As long as that doesn't happen, there will be a huge market for it waiting to be filled should you legalize distribution and possession.\n",

      "QuoteLOL.This whole scenario is hilarious. First I'll point out that the overwhelming majority of these burglars wouldn't have or be able to afford their own defense agencies or they wouldn't be burgling. Highline crime, cat burglars, pro bank robbers, etc would make up such a tiny fraction to be practically irrelevant in the vast majority of these cases. So why would executing these nobodies who are too poor to defend themselves be seen as a threat instead of a cost saving measure? Seems like all these defense agencies would be thrilled to offer a policy of execution of such riff raff as an add on service for an additional fee. And that you would even propose that other agencies will band together and go to war to \"incapacitate\" an agency for the rights of these poor nobodies ... ROTFL! It's just hysterical.   I don't think that many people would WANT someone who burglarized them to be executed for doing so, so I doubt that many people would buy such an add on package. If an agency starts killing people for minor crimes, I believe that other defense agencies will attempt to put a stop to it even if nobody is paying them to do so. QuoteWishful thinking. If people can be indoctrinated enough to fund religion, they can be brainwashed enough to fund the WoD too. Probably some will continue to fund the war on drugs, however the funding would be significantly cut. QuoteNot really sure what would distinguish any of these private armies from the DEA really.

Silk road serves as a sort of private defense agency, it offers protection to any drug users / dealers who wish to use it, and in return for this service the operators receive a percentage of the profits made. Silk road is a purely defensive operation though. An example of an offensive operation would be an assassination market. An assassination market could exist where people put bets on the time of death of DEA agents, or the time when a \"terrorist\" attack is carried out against DEA agents. When such an even occurs, the person who bet closest to the event wins the entire jackpot, probably payable with Bitcoins. Now every drug dealer who desires freedom from the DEA will be encouraged to place bets on when these events occur. This will create a large sum of Bitcoins available to whoever most closely predicts the time of an event that is negative to the DEA. So if the pot for the bombing of a DEA building gets high enough, agencies and/or independent actors that wish to collect this jackpot will be encouraged to take actions that cause their predicted date of attack to be correct. Drug dealers will be encouraged to place bets if they wish for the DEA to be compromised, but even the drug dealers / users who cannot afford to place bets or who don't want to place bets, will gain an advantage from the carried out offensive action. This is one possible mechanism of action that would allow my claim to be true, although there are many others as well. QuoteDitto on Comsec's point about re-victimization of the victims that the continued distribution of repackaged images does.Revictimization is such a bullshit claim. First of all, child porn crime scenes are the only crime scenes that it is illegal to view photographs of. Thus, there is inconsistency in the law if this is truly the reason why you think CP possession should be illegal. Why are people not tried for war crimes when they view images of the holocaust? Why is it legal to possess images of rape so long as the person being raped is not a minor? Second of all, if you want to make the claim that the child rightfully owns the image in which they appear, and you are arguing with someone who agrees that information can be owned, then it makes me wonder why are CP possessors given sentences that are more severe than child rapists are given, instead of tried in civil court with the other information property rights violators? So again there is inconsistency. Additionally, the true violator of the child's privacy is the person who publishes the image in the first place. This is the child molester, who I have already established is a criminal for engaging in child molestation. Also, what about the CP willingly and intentionally produced and distributed by young teenagers? The entire argument of re-victimization completely falls apart in such cases. Additionally, if it is a privacy violation that is the cause for child porn viewing to be illegal, then why is it not illegal to view spy cam pornography of adults? Some more inconsistency. Not to mention the fact that it is completely futile to make child porn illegal in an effort to ameliorate a victims fears that someone is viewing the material they are in, even the feds admit that once CP is released to the internet it is virtually impossible to remove it completely, and this is with laws against CP viewing already in full effect. So in short, the people who argue from this basis, believe in a magical process and additionally are entirely inconsistent when it comes to what they think the laws should be when it comes to viewing photographs of a crime scene, viewing photographs in which someones privacy has been violated and the penalties that should be given to violators of information property. Once you realize that you realize that they are just making shit up to justify the fact that they want to enslave people who view CP. QuoteRidiculous.

The economic forces of supply and demand may be established, but when there is an infinite supply already existing that far exceeds the demand of essentially everybody, the model starts to become less applicable. There are millions and millions of unique CP images and videos, essentially infinite copies of these images and videos can be made for free, only the most die hard CP traders obtain even a small fraction of the currently available CP. Additionally I already said that paying for production and production should be illegal. I think that they would have made almost exactly as much because they advertised via spam, and regardless of the content they had I think the people who joined would have joined in either case. Shit, the same people would have probably joined and/or not joined even if they had no child pornography at all and it was really a sting operation from the get go. I believe that the number of people who joined would be consistent regardless of the sort of material they had, or if they had any material at all, and thus I believe the number of people who joined is representative of the current demand for commercial CP. It is likely that the demand for commercial CP would increase if it was legal to pay for CP, yet it is even more likely that the fact that CP is widely and freely available would majorly counter the amount of money going into commercialized CP. Also I have put forward a coherent explanation of why supply and demand does not apply to CP, and if I am not mistaken I gave a citation to a publication from a Ph.D holding researcher saying that there is no empirical evidence for the market theory of CP and additionally a quote from a federal employee claiming that supply and demand is not applicable to CP. \n",

It is illegal for the government to give a specific religion exceptions to the controlled substance act without giving all people the same exception. This is your subjective interpretation, and a very poorly reasoned one at that. It's not \"favoritism\" to a certain religion over another religion. There are no Christian denominations demanding to use DMT that are being denied the right because of favoritism that I'm aware of. There is nothing in the constitution that says that protected religious practices ruled unlawful by the general population must be granted to everyone that doesn't practice the religion. Nor is there anything protecting someone underage who sips wine at the alter during mass in practicing their Christian religion that would protect them from prosecution if doing so outside of religious worship.

And why not? It would seem to provide some fantastic extra deterrent value. Who's a burglar going to try and rob, someone known for having intruders executed or one that doesn't?The concept is to pit defense agencies against each other. There is no pretense of legitimacy, so as long as one defense agency does not gain total dominion over the others, it might be a very good system.Quote from: jpinkman on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmQuoteIf an agency starts killing people for minor crimes, I believe that other defense agencies will attempt to put a stop to it even if nobody is paying them to do so. But your belief that this will happen follows no rhyme or reason. Especially since executing people for burglary could provide a lucrative financial incentive as an add on service, as I just explained as to why it would, it makes absolutely no sense as to why a security firm owner would risk himself and his assets by going to war with another security firm that is merely practicing good 'ole capitalism.Warfare is extremely expensive. Every true capitalist knows this. It is better to settle on certain unofficial protocols between defense agencies rather than risk expensive warfare between defense agencies, because that would eat through profits very quickly.If it were governments, which is defined here as a total monopoly on defense within a given geographical region, it would be called international law, but here they are given no such overt legitimacy.Quote from: jpinkman on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmQuoteI will use silk road for an example.

OK, but my point was that there'd be really no distinction between the DEA and any other cartel if the DEA would even exist at all in a world with no government. What gives the DEA its power is the legitimacy it derives from the enormous might of the US government. In a world with no government, it's questionable whether such an ideological organization could get a leg up on everyone unless it was given legitimacy by a similarly powerful but private security firm or coalition of firms. And if there were such an all-powerful mandate from private security firms that created a DEA division to go around enslaving and killing people for drug use, manufacturing, etc. I think the population would probably have a lot more to worry about than having their drugs confiscated like battling the tyranny of the security mafias repressing them.Although I'm curious, given your belief in the viability of an assassination market of DEA agents, why you think it hasn't happened yet.No one else has bothered yet. I'm actually designing one, but I'm still in the early phases of design. No code yet.I offered to permit others to have design input or contribution, but nobody was interested, so I'm doing it alone.Once there is a significant codebase, I'm sure people will start showing interest, but it may take a year to get to that point.Quote from: jpinkman on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmQuoteRevictimization is such a bullshit claim.So if you were raped as a child you'd have no problem with your rape images being widely circulated legally.

So again there is inconsistency.I don't see the relevance of whether laws are consistent or not in the punishment they mete out as to whether a person is further victimized should their rape images be allowed to distributed legally without their consent.The consistency of the law is extremely relevant.Again, why are images of specific Jews being slain not illegal? Why are people who view scenes of war and carnage not persecuted the same way?It's illogical.Where punishment and deterrent measures are being meted out, it's always relevant when these measures are not even sensical or reasonable.It's always relevant when the tyrants who rule us are batshit insane.Quote from: jpinkman on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmQuoteAlso, what about the CP willingly and intentionally produced and distributed by young teenagers?

I had no idea that was perfectly legal to produce and distribute.On the same thread, if the basis of prohibition of CP is privacy, and this privacy carries over into the childrens' adulthood, then why is privacy eroded everywhere else?What about wiretapping? Why is it not illegal to wiretap households with children?

Not only are there vertical markets to be exploited when demand increases, but there are horizontal markets where the same consumers can be recycled into purchasing numerous memberships. Some will be more highly valued than others, and therefore able to charge more. Guess which ones?What do you mean by vertical and horizontal markets?

You haven't offered a coherent explanation. The only explanation you offered was that it doesn't apply because of P2P or within the p2p framework. I've already refuted that by pointing to the adult model. You have yet to provide a coherent explanation of why the adult model wouldn't apply. You bring up that production would remain illegal, as if the increased demand from legalizing and monetizing distribution channels that would drive up the price wouldn't somehow increase production when that is lala land talk.I think we've reached an impasse, and discussing this further without new participants has officially reached pointlessness.jpinkman will never acknowledge the distinction between CP filesharing and production in terms of demand, and jpinkman will never acknowledge the distinction between CP viewers who view amateur pornography of each other, and viewers who demand freshly-produced hardcore content, and are willing to pay for it.Those are important distinctions to make. If there is proof, such as dissertations by renowned doctors on the topic, jpinkman is highly unlikely to take that into consideration.kmfkewm, I have a few questions for you, myself.In a world where private defense agencies are the only forces of law and order in a lawless land, how would your previously-stated prohibitions on child pornography production be enforced? I'm afraid I'm not very familiar with the concepts involved, since I still have a lot of reading to do on Libertarian thought.Another question I have is how you'd build a voluntary social welfare system? I've seen conceptual systems in places like Italy where employers, employees, and unemployed people work cooperatively to help support families and such. How would you approach social justice in a lawless stateless society? Is it something that would interest you?A few other questions regarding CP would be whether you would regard exploitation of children in other cultures or subcultures relevant to your society, and whether you would be willing to commit major resources to total warfare, or wars of extermination against those cultures, even though you don't have any real claim of responsibility over those children. What are your views on this?\n",

Peoples own selfish desires will be enough that they will want penalties for crimes to reflect the crimes. Of course some people are insane and think that possession of marijuana warrants severe penalties, but I am not arguing that everyone will be in favor of realistic punishments for crimes, only that enough will be that defense agencies will be forced into constraints. If an agency is killing people for relatively small crimes, people will find it in their best interests to put a stop to this.

However, they do make a substantial income from robbing drug dealers and selling drug users into slavery, and I imagine that they will continue to do this even if the US government collapses. They make enough money just stealing drug money that they could largely support themselves even without external financial support, although it will still be bad for them financially if they cannot use the force of the entire US government in order to extort money from non-drug dealers/users as well. I agree that we have a lot to worry about more than the DEA, we have a full tyrannical government to be concerned about! It seems like over 30% of people on SR think we should battle them :). I do believe that an assassination market of DEA agents and other government officials is possible. Jim Bell partially implemented an assassination market, although he was promptly arrested for tax evasion and various other charges as well. Two of his friends also attempted to implement one but I don't know what ever came of that, they were possibly arrested as well for some unrelated things. One of the reasons an assassination market might be difficult, although not impossible, to pull off is because of the fact that the NSA and similar intelligence agencies might not be to fond of it. Something like SR, they are extremely unlikely to involve themselves, but an assassination market against government officials is likely to be something they would concern themselves with. The anonymity of Tor is not enough to prevent such an agency from locating clients / servers, and thus they would be able to quickly find such a market if hosted on a hidden service. Additionally, they can hack into most any server, and would perhaps be able to steal the bitcoin pools and cause general havoc. Additionally they would be able to trace the operator and arrest him/her, as well as determine everyone who placed a bet. This problem can be countered though, if the market is not hosted on a hidden service but rather over a high latency network consisting of highly secured mixes. NSA is not an easy agency to take security measures against, but I do not think it is impossible to be secure and anonymous from them, although perhaps with the technologies of today it would be quite difficult. Another issue is that if such a site is set up, potential assassins will not be certain that they will receive a payout from carrying out the action. After all, the site could be run by scammers. So they will be taking a very large risk with no certainty of receiving payment. Additionally, a lot of people may be too afraid to place bets or they might dismiss the entire market from the get go. That said, I do think that such a market could exist but it would need to be exponentially more secure and anonymous than any of the other illegal networks are, because if it actually worked and gathered any significant participation, it would quickly become a high priority target for many police and much more importantly intelligence agencies. Hm, I read a paper about an anonymous AND undetectable covert channel system the other day. An interesting feature of the discussed system is that unlike mix networks and low latency onion type networks, it does NOT need its own dedicated infrastructure, rather it piggy backs off of servers on the internet in general. It allows Alice and Bob to communicate without either revealing their identity to the other, and it is covert in that there is an extremely low probability of third parties determining that Alice and Bob are communicating with each other OR that Alice or Bob  are communicating covertly at all. I imagine software to create a group communication channel using a system similar to this would be required for the assassination market site, strong crypto would be required for validation of bet placement, and payment would need to be with bitcoin which would additionally need to be heavily mixed and preferably cashed out as anonymously as possible as well.QuoteSo if you were raped as a child you'd have no problem with your rape images being widely circulated legally. I see. But I don't think most would agree with you. I certainly wouldn't want my shit spread around like that for all to see.Although I would not want my rape images spread around, I would also recognize that I do not have a right to prevent other people from accessing information on the internet. QuoteI'm not following. You're saying possessing CP is not illegal if not done at the crime scene?No I referred to child porn as a crime scene photograph, which is one of the many politically correct terms for CP. I believe the currently used word is Child Abuse Materials, or CAM. People in the government and organizations against child porn do not like it to be called pornography because they say that this implies it is similar to consensual adult pornography, when in reality it is a photograph of a crime scene (hence Crime(scene) Photograph, as comsec called it), or a photograph of child abuse, hence Child Abuse Material. My point was mostly to Comsec, and to reiterate my point is that CP is the only case in which it is illegal to view a photograph of a crime scene, and this is not consistent. It does not make sense to argue that child porn  possession or distribution should be illegal because CP is photographic evidence of a crime, if you do not hold the belief that ALL photographic evidence of crimes should be illegal to distribution or possess. Nobody believes this to be the case really, I have never heard for a ban on images of the holocaust, and certainly the holocaust was a massive crime against humanity. Thus the people who argue against CP possession legalization on this ground are unprincipled in their argument, because if they were principled then they would argue for all crime scene images to be made illegal to distribute or possess. QuoteI don't see the relevance of whether laws are consistent or not in the punishment they mete out as to whether a person is further victimized should their rape images be allowed to distributed legally without their consent.I was merely pointed out that the people who argue against CP possession/distribution legalization, on the grounds that CP = crime scene photographs, are unprincipled people who hold inconsistent beliefs. To argue against what you just said, I would ask why you think that the information stealing crime of possessing CP without consent of the victim should be treated differently than other information stealing crimes, which are generally civil matters for possessors (although criminal for distributors). To the extent that a person is victimized by the continued spread of the CP they are in, I would place the blame entirely on the person who originally produced the photograph. Additionally, depending on your definition of revictimization, you may very well simply be insane to think that viewing a CP image revictimizes the child. Certainly the definition of revictimization that I most frequently run into (causing the child to experience the abuse all over again) is complete and utter bullshit with no mapping to reality. I can see that some privacy violation does occur, which I would blame on the original person who published the images.QuoteWhat about it? Maybe this is content that shouldn't be prohibited if it they give their consent. Doesn't change the fact that it shouldn't be distributed for those that don't.  Okay so you think that CP possession is an information stealing crime. Why should it not be a civil rather than criminal matter then? QuoteAdditionally, if it is a privacy violation that is the cause for child porn viewing to be illegal, then why is it not illegal to view spy cam pornography of adults? Some more inconsistency. QuoteBecause adult porn is not illegal. Seems perfectly consistent to me.I can only imagine that you did not think this reply out all the way. This is circular logic. if you believe:1. It should be illegal for CP to be viewed or possessed because it is a privacy violationand:2. Spy camera footage of naked adults is a violation of the adults privacy but also believe that3. Spy camera footage of naked adults not being illegal on privacy violation grounds and child pornography being illegal on privacy violation grounds is not inconsistent and your supporting reasoning for the third point is4. Because child pornography is illegal and adult pornography isn'tthen you essentially are saying \"Child pornography should be illegal because child pornography is illegal\"seems like a pretty dumb argument to me, I think you are more intelligent than to use such piss poor circular logic too. Maybe you are tired or something ??QuoteSo because it might be impossible to remove it completely your reasoning is that carte blanche should be given so that not only is the image not reduced to a minimum from circulation but it can be freely distributed at will. Yeah who gives a shit about the victim anyway huh?It is just worth pointing out that if the reason for making child pornography possession illegal is because the victim fears their photo being seen, then it is an entirely pointless effort as even if the photograph IS entirely removed from circulation the victim will have no way of actually knowing that and thus will continue to fear.QuoteEnslave people who view CP.  Hm. Yeah what evil bastards huh? Even though I didn't hear one coherent argument in there, ok. People who view CP are frequently enslaved, they are captured by FBI or ICE for a bounty (salary) and then sold to the prison industrial complex.  \n",

And why not? It would seem to provide some fantastic extra deterrent value. Who's a burglar going to try and rob, someone known for having intruders executed or one that doesn't?The concept is to pit defense agencies against each other. There is no pretense of legitimacy, so as long as one defense agency does not gain total dominion over the others, it might be a very good system.I'm not following. What does your concept have anything to do with what was being discussed? I'm talking about the ethics of having burglars executed.Quote from: raynardine on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmWarfare is extremely expensive. Every true capitalist knows this. It is better to settle on certain unofficial protocols between defense agencies rather than risk expensive warfare between defense agencies, because that would eat through profits very quickly.Which was my point. There's not reason to go to war to stop other defense agencies from executing burglars.Quote from: raynardine on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmNo one else has bothered yet. I'm actually designing one, but I'm still in the early phases of design. No code yet.I offered to permit others to have design input or contribution, but nobody was interested, so I'm doing it alone.Once there is a significant codebase, I'm sure people will start showing interest, but it may take a year to get to that point.Interesting.Quote from: raynardine on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmI'm still curious about whether you think animated or drawn media with obviously underaged characters should be illegal.I'm curious as to why you didn't see my long reply to your post already.Quote from: raynardine on February 04, 2013, 05:01 pmThe consistency of the law is extremely relevant.Again, why are images of specific Jews being slain not illegal? Why are people who view scenes of war and carnage not persecuted the same way?It's illogical.Where punishment and deterrent measures are being meted out, it's always relevant when these measures are not even sensical or reasonable.It's always relevant when the tyrants who rule us are batshit insane.I should probably narrow what I said. I don't see the relevance of whether it's prosecuted in criminal or civil court as being pertinent to the ethics of the free distribution of CP against a victim's consent.QuoteWhat about adults who are punished and persecuted for distributing CP of themselves they produced as minors? What about teenagers who are punished for distributing CP of themselves amongst each other? Should these people be thrown into prison as well?Definitely not. The key word in what I said was \"consent\".QuoteThe argument wasn't about the child (who is almost certainly an adult at this point), the argument was about wasting taxpayer money on enforcing laws that cannot be enforced.You know, like the folly of prohibiting drugs. It's a waste of taxpayer money.Sure they can. If distribution and possession of the individual's image is illegal, anyone caught distributing and possessing will be prosecuted. How is that not enforceable?Quote\"People who view CP\" is actually a lot broader than you realize, especially if you count children on Skype, teenagers who record short video clips of themselves and share the files with each other as part of a consensual relationship, and other borderline cases.You seem to be making a lot of assumptions about what \"I think\". Perhaps you should review the entirety of posts I\"ve made in this thread to kfm to get a better handle on it.QuoteBut of course the victims cannot give consent in your view, even if they are wiser and more responsible than adults for that exact reason. I can imagine what you would say regarding teenagers and young adults having a relationship, so I won't even ask you about that.Straw man.

Particularly, what if someone in your family decides to steal something one day? Will you want them to be executed for doing so? Of course not. Peoples own selfish desires will be enough that they will want penalties for crimes to reflect the crimes.I see this as being grossly idealistic. I think there are quite a few people who would use the rationalization of \"well, i would never burgle someone and the world is a better place without such vermin anyway so I'm doing the world a favor by having them executed plus providing extra deterrent value to warn against future burglars\". For starters, I could see the entirety of the law abiding citizens of Texas alone thinking this way, not even counting the rest of the deep south. :)QuoteOf course some people are insane and think that possession of marijuana warrants severe penalties, but I am not arguing that everyone will be in favor of realistic punishments for crimes, only that enough will be that defense agencies will be forced into constraints. If an agency is killing people for relatively small crimes, people will find it in their best interests to put a stop to this.The \"people\" will have no say about stopping it. It would be the decision of agency owners whether to go to war with the agencies doing it. I see no incentive (and actually quite a bit of risk and downside) for them to do so. Much more likely would be that all agencies would be participating in the cash grab of offering this add on service.QuoteI agree that without the US government the DEA would be in a tough position. However, they do make a substantial income from robbing drug dealers and selling drug users into slavery, and I imagine that they will continue to do this even if the US government collapses. I sort of doubt it. Maybe after splintering into a ton of smaller gangs and units maybe, but it's the cohesiveness of the gov hierarchy and as paymasters that keeps them structured under one umbrella. Without that there'd be a bunch of internal power struggles and splintering if they stayed together at all. Then they'd resemble nothing more than gangs of toughs and robbers with sophisticated weapons, if they were able to retain those.QuoteThey make enough money just stealing drug money that they could largely support themselves even without external financial support, although it will still be bad for them financially if they cannot use the force of the entire US government in order to extort money from non-drug dealers/users as well.I agree. I think this would be fatal.QuoteI agree that we have a lot to worry about more than the DEA, we have a full tyrannical government to be concerned about! It seems like over 30% of people on SR think we should battle them :). You see this is where you and I disagree. Outside of the fucked up drug laws I don't feel particularly oppressed by tyrannical government. I know you've got your opinions on taxation as theft equaling your enslavement so this is true for you.

      "\t\t\t\tan assassination market would need something like this I think. sans math formulas (at least properly formatted) and graphs. Quote1IntroductionThis work contributes to the understanding of covert communications on de-ployed networks such as the Internet. We show that if any shared state can beaccessed and influenced by two parties they can use it to communicate indirectly,making it hard for observers to correlate senders and receivers of messages. Wealso present a very common feature of the IP protocol [28, 27], based on the IPIDpacket field, that can be used to implement such covert communications. As aresult our scheme does not require a dedicated infrastructure (as mix networksdo), but uses any of the large number of deployed machines to relay messages.We further show that the ‘noise’ produced by other, innocuous users, canbe used to enhance covertness – given the observer does not know the sharedkey it becomes difficult to assess whether there is a communication at all. Toachieve this we are inspired by techniques close to DSSS, that allow for lowpower signals to be hidden and uncovered from high noise environment. Finallywe note that our scheme allows for covert communication despite, even stringent,data retention. This is partly due to the low level mechanisms we rely on (rawIP packets) and the very low signal power that would require prolonged, verycostly, observation to allow the identification of a communication.We first introduce in Section 3 the requirements of a cover communicationsystems, and discuss why established technologies only partially satisfy them. InSection 4 we present the basic TCP/IP mechanisms on which we shall build twosystems: a basic one based on ICMP Echo requests (Section 4.2) and a second,more covert one, based on TCP circuits (Section 4.3). We discuss extensions andopen issues in Section 5 and present our conclusions in Section 6.2Background and Related WorkCovert and jamming resistant communications are a well studied discipline inthe field of military and civilian radio communications. Low probability of in-tercept and position fix techniques like frequency hopping and Direct SequenceSpread Spectrum (DSSS) have been developed to force an adversary to spenda lot of power to jam a signal, as well as to hide altogether the existence of acommunication from those that do not know a shared key [5]. Such technolo-gies have been deployed in military tactical radios, but have also become partof civilian communications with frequency hopping being used in GSM phones,and CDMA (a variant of DSSS that uses orthogonal codes) being used in mobilecommunications and high-speed modems.Yet relatively little attention has been directly payed to the covertness ofcommunication in the context of the Internet. The field of anonymous communi-cations, as started by David Chaum’s [13] proposal for mixes and mix networks,attempts to provide unlinkability of senders and receiver. These anonymity prop-erties fall short of full covertness, in that an observer is in a position to determinethat some form of communication is taking place. Jamming resistance is also dif-ficult to achieve, since the anonymous communication infrastructure in deployedsystems [14, 23, 15], can easily be targeted and rendered inoperable by a pow-erful adversary. A peer-to-peer approach [18, 29] to providing anonymity maychange this, but so far no such system was found to provide strong anonymityproperties.Steganography [6], the embedding of ciphertext into innocuous data, also pro-vides some form of covertness. An adversary observing a communication cannotdetermine its content with certainty, and messages can be transferred underthe cover of ‘normal’ traffic. Yet steganography does not hide the acts of com-munication themselves, or the communicating parties. Therefore traffic analysistechniques that map social structures [30, 21] to extract information would stillbe able to uncover information. Such techniques often ignore content and are un-likely (in the absence of cover traffic – which would bring us back to anonymouscommunications) to be affected by steganographic techniques.Despite the little attention payed to covertness properties, traceability ofcommunications has become a policy hot topic. National legislatures, often af-ter terrorist incidents, have imposed ‘traffic data retention’ requirements on thetelecommunications and Internet service provider industries [12, 20, 24], forcingthem to log call, information access and location data (not content). At a Eu-ropean level EU Directive 2002/58/EC [3] (Directive on Privacy and ElectronicCommunications) and its December 2005 amendment [4] respectively allowingand making retention mandatory, replaced Dir. 1995/46/EC [1] (Data Protec-tion Directive) and Dir. 97/66/EC [2] (Telecommunications Privacy Directive)that prohibited such practices. The granularity of the retained data is variable,and the directives and laws often refer to communications in an abstract man-ner to allow for technology independence. As a rule of thumb for this work weshall assume that everything that is routinely logged in deployed systems shallbe available for inspection. This requirement is much more stringent than themost draconian data retention schemes proposed, that usually only require log-ging high (application) level communication events and user identification events(when the user is authenticating to an ISP). Relaxing the attacker models wouldmake covert communication more efficient, yet the principles to achieve a securescheme would be the same as presented in this paper.There exist other, simpler, approaches to circumvent traffic data retentionand achieve covert communications in practice. The simplest approach wouldbe to use one of the many open relays documented in the SORBS list, for anti-spam purposes. These include SMTP (email) and SOCKS (any TCP stream)relays that would allow two parties to get in contact and talk. Another moreambitious solution would be to establish a bot-net, composed of many compro-mised machines, and deploy a parallel communication infrastructure that doesnot log anything. These solutions rely on the assumption that the relays arenot observed by the adversary, which is most probably true. The solutions wepropose on the other hand allow covert communication even when under someforms of surveillance. In this sense our techniques take advantage of the funda-mental limits of traceability versus covertness, and raise significantly the cost ofsurveillance.3Covert Communication RequirementsAlice and Bob would like to communicate without Eve, the adversary, beingable to observe them. They share a symmetric key K, unknown to Eve, and canuse established cryptography techniques to protect the secrecy and integrity ofexchanged messages. In addition to this they would like the mere act of commu-nication to be unobservable to Eve: Eve should not learn that Alice or Bob arecommunicating with each other, or engaging in an act of covert communication.Hiding the fact that Alice and Bob are communicating with each other couldbe achieved using anonymous communication protocols [13, 23, 14, 15]. Yet theseprotocols (like encryption itself) are very easy to detect, therefore jeopardisingcovertness. They use standard handshakes, fixed message sizes and formats, amore or less fixed and public infrastructure. As a result, it is easy for Eve todetermine that Alice and Bob (along with many others) are taking part in ananonymous communication protocol – which in many cases would give rise tosuspicion. Due to their dependence on mixing infrastructure such systems mayalso be prone to legal compulsion (to log or reveal keys), targeted denial ofservice attacks or blocking.The straight forward composition of steganography and anonymous com-munications comes also short of providing both anonymity and covertness. Amessage, that possibly contains steganographic embedded information, that istransported anonymously is already very suspicious, and a clear indication thatthe sender and the receiver (although not linked) are taking part in some covertcommunication. On the other hand a mere steganographic message might pro-vide covertness of content, in that the true message is not revealed to Eve, butalso provides a clear link between Alice and Bob.We therefore propose that covert communication mechanisms should havecertain characteristics.Definition: A covert communication system has to make use of unintendedfeatures of commonly used protocols, in a way that does not arise suspicion, inorder to unobservably relay messages between two users.The use of common communication protocols is essential in not arousing sus-picion, since any deviation from the norm may indicate an act of covert commu-nication. The challenge is to find generic enough features of common protocolsthat allows messages to be relayed through third party machines. Any directcommunication between Alice and Bob would create a link between them, thatmay in the eyes of Eve contain a covert channel or steganographicaly embeddedinformation. On the other hand the use of an intended communication channelprovided by a third party can be subject to logging and interception. As a resultthe only option for implementing covert communications is to use unintendedfeatures that allow relaying of messages. Furthermore these features should beexploitable without giving rise to suspicion to an observer (which again wouldjeopardize covertness).Given all these requirements it is surprising that such features, not only existin deployed communication protocols, but they are abundant.The security of any covert communication scheme is dependent on the ob-servation capabilities of the adversary. We wish to mostly consider an adversarythat observes the world through retained traffic data. Furthermore, we wouldideally want to provide security against a global passive observer, that has ac-cess to any information transiting on the network. We present a spectrum ofsystems, protecting Alice and Bob from an Eve with increasing surveillance ca-pabilities. As we expect the more we bound and reduce Eve’s capabilities themore efficient our systems can be, while still remaining covert.There are also inherent advantages to finding and exploiting low level networkmechanisms to provide covert communications. First low level mechanisms arelikely to be used in a variety of ways, depending on the protocols that arestacked on them. This adds variance to the network behavior that would allowcommunications to be more effectively hidden. Secondly, low level mechanismsare also more abundant – more machines run vanilla TCP/IP than a particularversion of a web-service. This allows for more choice when it comes to findinga relay, which in turn increases the cost of an adversary that has to observeall potential hosts for communication. Finally low level protocols produce highgranularity traffic data, the storage of which is orders of magnitude more costlythan storing high level network events – compare the cost of storing web accesslogs versus the cost of storing the header of every single IP packet traversing anetwork.In the next sections we concentrate on a particular feature of many InternetProtocol (IP) implementations, namely sequential IPID values, that is low leveland exhibits all the necessary characteristics to facilitate covert communications.4A Covert Communications SystemOur key contribution is to show that there is a ubiquitous feature of deployedIP networks that allows for covert communication. The Internet is a collectionof networks that ‘talk’ the same Internet Protocol (IP) [27] to exchange packetscontaining information. Each packet starts with a header that contains routinginformation, but also a special identification IPID field. The IPID field is 16 bitslong, and is used to detect duplicate packets and perform fragmentation andreassembly of IP packets in the network. The creator of the IP packet sets itsidentification field to “a value that must be unique for that source-destinationpair and protocol for the time the datagram will be active in the Internet sys-tem.” [27]Many deployed operating systems and TCP/IP stacks use a simple counterto set the value of the IPID field on outgoing packets. This feature has beenused in the past to perform security sensitive monitoring in a manner of ways.Steven Bellovin uses the serial nature of the IPID field to monitor the number ofdifferent machines behind a Network Address Translation (NAT) gateway [10].The IPID can be determined either by a global or a ‘per-host’ counter. Theavailability of some machines with global counter makes possible a techniquesknown as ‘idle scan’ or ‘dump scan’ [8], that determines which TCP [28] ports amachine is listening to, without sending any direct traffic to it. This techniqueis implemented in the Nmap [19] network scanner. Applications of serial IPIDfields to remote monitoring and traffic analysis have also been proposed [7, 9,25].We are going to use the serial nature of IPID fields of many Internet con-nected computers in order to allow for covert communications. We explain howto implement covert communications using an intermediary that uses a globalIPID counter.Alice wants to talk to Bob, with whom she shares a key K, over an inter-mediary called Charlie. Charlie implements an IP stack that selects IPID valuesusing a global counter. Note that if Alice an Bob can force Charlie to emit pack-ets, and if they are able to observe any packet from charlie they will be ableto communicate. More concretely, Alice will at each time 2ti force Charlie toemit n packets, while Bob will observe a packet from Charlie at times 2ti + 1 toretrieve n. The number of packets n is the information that has been transferredbetween Alice and Bob. By repeating this process Alice can transmit to Bobarbitrary messages.The first question that arises is: how can Alice and Bob force Charlie to emitpackets, and receive packets from him. We shall present two ways in which thisis possible based on ICMP Echo [26] and TCP [28], in subsections 4.2 and 4.3.A second worry is that Charlie will also be generating traffic with thirdparties, incrementing the IPID counter, and adding noise to the observation ofBob. We note that this is a great opportunity for cover traffic: if Alice andBob were the only parties that Bob would be receiving and sending informationto, they may be linked easily by an observer. On the other hand if Charlie isengaging in multiple conversation, including with Alice and Bob, it is difficultfor even a direct observer to establish who may be communicating with whom.Furthermore we shall make it difficult for other clients to establish that there isany signal in the IPID data, by using the shared key K to allow Alice and Bobto communicate over that noisy channel.4.1Transmission over a noisy IPID counterAssume that Alice and Bob want to communicate the binary symbols n0 = 0or n1 = 1, over the channel. They use their secret key K in order to producetwo psedo-random traffic patterns v0 and v1 of length l corresponding to eachsymbols n0 and n1 respectively:v0i = H(0, i, K), ∀i ∈ [0, l − 1] (1)v1i = H(1, i, K), ∀i ∈ [0, l − 1] (2)We assume that H is a good hash function that takes bit strings and producesuniform values in the interval [0, 2μ]. As a result each symbol is mapped into atraffic pattern, which is a sequence of l values in the interval [0, 2μ]1 . Alice sendsin each round the number of packets specified in the sequence of the symbol shewishes to emit one value at each time period time. For example to transmit thestring ‘0110’, the sequence v0 , v1 , v1 , v0 should transmitted, which would take 4·ltime periods.Bob observes packets from Charlie with IPID increments, from one timeperiod to the next, of ui for i ∈ [0, l−1]. How does Bob determine the symbol sentby Alice? Based on the knowledge of K, Bob can construct a filter to determineif the traffic pattern v0 or v1 is embedded in the noise. To differentiate betweenthe two symbols Bob calculates the values r0 and r1 , for each candidate symbol:rj =vji ui ,j ∈ {0, 1}(3)i∈[0,l−1]The difference between the value of r associated with the correct symbol,versus the value of r associated with other symbols grows linearly with thelength of l. It can be shown (full derivation in Appendix A) that, if the selectionof traffic levels v follows a probability distribution D (in our example the uniformdistribution D = U (0, 2μ)), this difference is:(∆r) =(rcorrect − rincorrect) = l · Î(D)(4)The function Î denotes the variance of the distribution D.It is therefore clear that, if the key K is known, Bob can reconstruct theappropriate traffic patterns v to extract the correct symbols from the IPID inthe long run, despite any noise. Furthermore by increasing the length l of thetraffic pattern we can afford to keep the additional traffic injected by Alice lowand make it difficult for an observer to detect that any communication is takingplace.Our results hold for any distribution D, and therefore we are also free to usea traffic distribution that looks realistic i.e. that mimics the characteristics ofsome type of innocuous traffic. In fact the covertness our this scheme dependson the adversary’s ability to distinguish between the distribution D used and‘normal’ traffic, not containing any covert information.4.2An ICMP Echo realizationWe have established that if Alice can force Charlie to emit any packets, andBob can receive any packets from Charlie, Alice and Bob can communicatethrough Charlie using information encoded in the IPID field. The simplest wayfor Alice and Bob of achieving this is using the ICMP Echo [26] protocol, oftenreferred to as ‘ping’, that must be implemented by a compliant TCP/IP stack(although some firewalls block it). ICMP Echo allows a host to send a packet toa destination address, which in turn echos it back to the original sender. Alicecan therefore send ‘ping’ messages to force Charlie to increment his counter sinceresponding increases the counter by one. Bob can use the same facility to receivemessages from Charlie and determine the state of his IPID field.This simple minded approach provides surprisingly good results, yet has somesecurity shortcomings as we shall see. Figures 1, 2 and 3 illustrate a single runof our prototype in a low noise environment. For this experiment we used 30second long traffic patterns of length 30 (which indicates a time interval of atwhich Bob must observe the counter of one second) from a uniform distributionU (0, 100), to transmit one symbol out of an 8 bit alphabet.We first collect the data sent by Alice (figure 1). This data is likely to containsome low frequency noise, that can be filtered out, since it is not likely to containany useful information. To eliminate its effects we calculate the predictors r usinga randomly generated traffic pattern, and use this as the baseline for detection(this is equivalent to subtracting from rcorrect a random rincorrect providing us theresult we expected). The values of rincorrect for all times are shown in figure 2.Note some patterns emerging, that are due to the traffic patterns not beingorthogonal. These might represent a security problem since they leak the messagecontent and their regularity would leak the existence of a message. We shalldiscuss how to avoid them in the discussion section.\n",

      "QuoteYes and the constitution mandates that they do this, but it also mandates that they do not make laws respecting any religion , and thus ANYBODY being prohibited from using DMT or Mescaline is having their rights unconstitutionally infringed upon. It is a law respecting a certain religion to say that a certain religion has an exception from the law but nobody else does. I would have to agree with this. Even if US government supposedly, theoretically protects us from a specific religion taking over the state, by which I mean the entire country, not a territory (\"states\" have no rights, as everyone knows), the predominant religion still manages to push through modern blue laws regardless, and they use the excuse of tradition and historical artifacts to justify this. All the more reason we need a full-scale revolution.QuoteSo what? Can you really not see that they have the right to pass laws and govern the state as they want? The fact that they're religious is incidental. There is no guaranteed right to drink alcohol in the bill of rights. If someone doesn't like the alcohol laws in Utah, they can move. Utah is a very large territory. If you were born in Utah, and have the good luck to discover that everyone around him is batshit insane, moving out of such a large territory is prohibitively expensive, and the state deliberately makes it overly difficult and bothersome to migrate to other territories within the US, much less other countries.QuoteSo what exactly do you think separation of church and state means if not \"No laws shall be passed favoring religions\"? Religious based laws are prevalent, and that is largely why there is no real separation of church and state. It is impossible to have separation of church and state in a pseudo-democracy that consists overwhelmingly of religious people.I just thought I'd mention the cold hard fact that we do not live in a democracy. Every country other than us knows we live in a federal constitutional republic. There is no democracy here. It is propaganda and myth. Do not be fooled.QuoteWhy do you think gay marriage is banned? Because the Bible says that Homosexuals are an abomination and marriage is between a man and a woman. If the Bible said Homosexuals can marry, there would be no laws in USA against gay marriage.The separation of church and state is not a two-way street. The seperation of church and state was a deliberate limitation placed upon the federal constitutional republic, to defend the church from the state, not the other way around. Remember, our ancestors were pilgrims, and the memory of the state (monarchs) slaying most of them was still fresh. It was part of the reasoning behind limiting state power in the first place, though we see how well that turned out.QuoteIf there was really enforced separation of church and state, the state would not be able to limit business operating hours on Sunday solely because it is the Sabbath. There is no other reason to restrict business operating hours on the arbitrary ass day of Sunday, and only an idiot would think that they do this for any reason other than as a nod to the christian faith. They cannot make laws respecting religions, why should Buddhists be subjected to laws that are based on the Christian faith?I shudder to think what the state would be forced to do to pagans if the church really wanted to wipe us out.QuoteSo what? How does this violate \"congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion\"? There is no specific religion referenced.QuoteBy law public currency is stamped with \"In God we Trust\" , God is obviously a reference to the Christian God. It doesn't say in Allah we trust, it doesn't say in Buddha we trust, it says In God we Trust. Additionally it makes a claim that all people in the US are theists, which is complete bullshit. It is clearly unconstitutional for the government to have an official policy of putting Christian slogans on everything, they are PROHIBITED from establishing a state respected religion but only an idiot would think that they are not full supporters of Christianity in an official capacity.This is not historically accurate. The state is PROHIBITED from infringing upon protestant christian denominations. The state is perfectly free to slay anyone else.QuoteIn my militant libertarian world the Christians can feel free to live in their backwards ass cities, persecuting gays and staying stuck in the past. They also will be prevented from harassing non-Christians who stay away from their backwards asses. I will move to some area full of young people (who are atheist in much larger numbers) and chill with gays and druggies and other generally-not-insane-people, and they can all move to the south and condemn each us all to hell :).According to the Gospel of Snowcrash, if we enforced a Libertarian culture upon the state, and abolished it, the future holds that there would be small city-states called Burbs where people can choose to raise children. There would be fierce (sometimes violent) competition between them, since families vote with their wallets where to have children, and they are all roughly equivalent.QuoteSo the fuck what? The rehab facilities are not state institutions. AA might be a freak cult and use similar language to Christianity, but 'God' in AA can mean the higher power of the group itself and atheists in AA use it to mean that.Yes they are. This is cultural warfare at its finest.QuoteIt does not matter if the facilities are state institutions or not, the people who sentence you to attend them are acting in the official capacity as representatives of the state. By your logic it doesn't matter if judges sentence us to go to Catholic Church for ten years, because the Catholic church is not a state institution. Nonsense. Also AA is a christian cult, you can pretend they say God to mean some higher power but they say the lords prayer for fucks sake.QuoteIn November 1934, Wilson was visited by old drinking companion Ebby Thacher. Wilson was astounded to find that Thacher had been sober for several weeks under the guidance of the evangelical Christian Oxford Group.[17] Wilson took some interest in the group, but shortly after Thacher's visit, he was again admitted to Towns Hospital to recover from a bout of drinking. This was his fourth and last stay at Towns hospital under Doctor Silkworth's care. It was while undergoing treatment with The Belladonna Cure that Wilson experienced his \"Hot Flash\" spiritual conversion and quit drinking.[18] According to Wilson, while lying in bed depressed and despairing, he cried out, \"I'll do anything! Anything at all! If there be a God, let Him show Himself!\"[19] He then had the sensation of a bright light, a feeling of ecstasy, and a new serenity. He never drank again for the remainder of his life. Wilson described his experience to Dr. Silkworth, who told him, \"Something has happened to you I don't understand. But you had better hang on to it\".The cold hard facts speak for themselves.QuoteDo you realize that there can be a separation of church and state while the majority of people allowed to practice their religion of choice are Christians?QuoteChurches are exempt PRECISELY for the reason of church and state separation under the principle that there is no surer way to destroy the free exercise of religion than to tax it. This is not a separation between church and corporation, or church and citizen, but church and state. So where do you see the contradiction? Of couse individuals and corporations are taxed. You could make the claim any tax exempt organization, not just churches, are being paid by individuals and organizations by proxy. So? What's your point?Qualifying for tax exemption is difficult to the point of nigh impossibility unless you are a church. If you are a church, your qualification is a given. If you are not a church (of protestant christian denomination), it is deliberately nearly impossible to qualify for tax exempt status.You should read the tax code sometime, it's enlightening.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThe original poster must be American.  Only in America does \"Libertarian\" mean anarcho-capitalist.  In Europe it refers to libertarian socialist (anarcho-communist).  I only read the first page of this thread so apologies if this has been discussed.  I often find it bizarre that people who are against coercion and for freedom do not see the inherent coercion of capitalism.  How can you say people going to jobs they don't give a fuck about for their entire lives just so they can exchange food and housing credits (money) with the very same class of people they are spending their lives slaving away for just because those capitalists control the means of production and all the resources the working masses need for survival is not blatant coercion?  The absence of the state will not keep capitalist monopolies from forming.  In fact, if the state were smashed and private ownership of resources and production maintained there would be a new state immediately.  The state is the only entity that protects private ownership.  For instance, I buy a car because if I go and take it from the dealership owner he will call armed men with guns that my tax dollars pay for to come and take the car back and put me in jail or murder me.  So without the state, private police and militias (which is what existed before modern nation states) will take the place of the police to enforce property rights and ownership by FORCE.  I have met a few right libertarians/anarcho-capitalists and they almost always are failed entrepreneurs who feel the only reason their brilliance has not made them capitalist super stars is because the state is holding them back due to crony capitalism or some type of BS that would still occur after the current state were smashed and the inevitable rebirth of the state by the monied class would arise.  Look into anarcho-communism, it is not an oxymoron and contains literally no coercion.  Unless you think it is coercive to deny the product of the labor of the workers to people who don't want to work (i.e. the current capitalist class).\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThe post from DPR really brought this situation into perspective for me today.  Economics, especially on cartels, was really not one of my strong suits in graduate school.  I'm not sure many people can invoke a response from DPR so I think putting up my soapbox is in order, my work here is complete.  All I wanted to do was keep the dialogue a live so the community could have an honest debate over the subject matter.  If anyone hasn't had a chance to read DPR's recommendation and would like to, here it is:D. THE INSTABILITY OF THE CARTELAnalysis demonstrates that a cartel is an inherently unstableform of operation. If the joint pooling of assets in a commoncause proves in the long run to be profitable for each of theindividual members of the cartel, then they will act formally tomerge into one large firm. The cartel then disappears in themerger. On the other hand, if the joint action proves unprofitablefor one or more members, the dissatisfied firm or firmswill break away from the cartel, and, as we shall see, any suchindependent action almost always destroys the cartel. The cartelform, therefore, is bound to be highly evanescent and unstable.If joint action is the most efficient and profitable course foreach member, a merger will soon take place. The very fact thateach member firm retains its potential independence in the cartelmeans that a breakup could take place at any time. The cartelwill have to assign production totals and quotas to each ofthe member firms. This is likely to lead first to a good deal ofbickering among the firms over the assignment of quotas, witheach member attempting to gain a larger share of the assignment.Whatever basis quotas are assigned on will necessarily bearbitrary and will always be subject to challenge by one or moremembers.13 In a merger, or in the formation of one corporation,the stockholders, by majority vote, form a decision-makingorganization. In the case of a cartel, however, disputes ariseamong independent owning entities.Particularly likely to be restive under the imposed jointaction will be the more efficient producers, who will be eager toexpand their business rather than be fettered by shackles andquotas to provide shelter for their less efficient competitors.Clearly, the more efficient firms will be the ones to break up thecartel. This will be increasingly true as time goes on and conditionschange from the time the cartel was first formed. Thequotas, the jealously made agreements that formerly seemedplausible to all, now become intolerable restrictions for themore efficient firms, and the cartel soon breaks up; for once onefirm breaks away, expands output and cuts prices, the othersmust follow.If the cartel does not break up from within, it is even morelikely to do so from without. To the extent that it has earnedunusual monopoly profits, outside firms and outside producerswill enter the same field of production. Outsiders, in short, rushin to take advantage of the higher profits. But once one strongcompetitor arises to challenge it, the cartel is doomed. For asthe firms in the cartel are bound by production quotas, theymust watch new competitors expand and take away sales fromthem at an accelerating rate. As a result, the cartel must breakup under the pressure of the newcomers’ competition.14\n",

I mean the attackers have not tried to gain entry into the site enough to access information or to steal bitcoins. If bitcoins are what the attackers are after. So far that doesn't seem to be the case.  They have yet to bring the site down for even 2 days, a good fuck you hack, would be considerably more damaging. Like the hack Anonymous did to Stratfor, the U.S. Intelligence Cyber Security Company. Now there was some \" serious Fuck You\" hacking. Any kindergartener can download a LOIC and ping  an IP. Doing that over the TOR network requires some adjustment I would imagine, but Silk Road still has to have an IP to be identified by our computers, but the IP doesn't have to be associated with any physical address in TOR.I agree, I find this to be a very positive report, it seems more and more users are now able to at least access their accounts, whereas nobody seemed to be able to even get to the login screen all day Sunday. Any improvement is progress. RevDrGod, you seem to have some more in depth knowledge on how DDOS attacks could be carried out over the TOR network, care to share any insights with us? I don't think throwing money at DPR would help at all, if it would then he would be asking for donations.

      "Quote from: QualityMeds on April 29, 2013, 02:37 pmQuote from: RevDrGod on April 29, 2013, 02:22 pmIf you guy's are getting on even for a moment, then things are improving, and DPR is doing a good job getting things up so quickly.  These attacks are annoying, but they are hardly serious. I mean the attackers have not tried to gain entry into the site enough to access information or to steal bitcoins. If bitcoins are what the attackers are after. So far that doesn't seem to be the case.  They have yet to bring the site down for even 2 days, a good fuck you hack, would be considerably more damaging. Like the hack Anonymous did to Stratfor, the U.S. Intelligence Cyber Security Company. Now there was some \" serious Fuck You\" hacking. Any kindergartener can download a LOIC and ping  an IP. Doing that over the TOR network requires some adjustment I would imagine, but Silk Road still has to have an IP to be identified by our computers, but the IP doesn't have to be associated with any physical address in TOR.I agree, I find this to be a very positive report, it seems more and more users are now able to at least access their accounts, whereas nobody seemed to be able to even get to the login screen all day Sunday. Any improvement is progress. RevDrGod, you seem to have some more in depth knowledge on how DDOS attacks could be carried out over the TOR network, care to share any insights with us? I don't think throwing money at DPR would help at all, if it would then he would be asking for donations. He has all the money he could ever want to play around with, it's just a matter of having the right people on his side that can be trusted.

I only understand how that works on the clear net. From what I have read about hack jobs, serious hacks are usually after something, hear it appears that they have just shut us down temporarily.\n",

      "Quote from: Norfolk83 on May 04, 2013, 12:13 pmI doubt its LE too. While this site does allow illegal trading of narcotics its much better to have us disjointed drug users sat safely behind our computers patiently waiting for our postman to deliver our goods than driving around the most dangerous of neighborhood's searching for our fixes.  Im sure this site has helped reduce street crime and at the same time support our ailing national postal services. Its win win, but not for everyone it seems..It's certainly true that Silk Road would help reduce crime and make the drug industry a lot better, but this is not how the war on drugs works. It is not concerned with the health of drug users or the amount of crime they do or do not commit. It is a moral war fought basically \"because drugs are bad, mkay?\", and for a bunch of different and often racist reasons if you look at the history. It's hardly even fought because of that anymore, but more because nobody has the political backbone to stand up against it until they are out of power. Besides, what are you going to do with all those people who live in places where the illegal drug trade was the only viable employment opportunity? They might stop fighting for crumbs between themselves and demand actual jobs and livelihoods.It's all about PR. Bringing down Silk Road would be amazing PR. Even though it is an utterly insignificant part of the drugs market (in economic terms), it's so hilariously brazen and is a huge fuck you to the drug war - which makes it a target.But as I said, an attack like this makes no sense from a PR perspective. From where I'm standing, very few attacks will not conclude with the media asking \"But wait, aren't there still like thousands of people still buying drugs online?\" Short of catching DPR, there's not much they can make noise about that won't just make the site even more mainstream with even more users. I do fear though, that as more and more users start to use the site, making it obvious that it cannot be stopped and is going to change the war on drugs, and it actually starts harming the PR of law enforcement (instead of being largely a non-issue as it is now), things could get messy as LE desperately lashes out in attempts to scare people away from using the site. But I don't think that will happen until basically everybody knows about the site, and at that point we've pretty much won. Or it will be the end of the postal system and the beginning of some shitty dystopia.Ha, that was meant to be like a 4 sentence response. Edit: Here's a promising update on just how mainstream silk road is getting. Promising if you think mainstream is a good thing, which I basically do.CLEARNET http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2013/apr/18/internet-drug-dealing-survey CLEARNET\"But responses to the Global Drug Survey, an annual academic research poll with more than 7,000 UK respondents, suggest Silk Road is merely the most visible aspect of a much wider phenomenon.Just under a third of survey respondents had heard of the Silk Road marketplace, while 14% had set up an account on the site and browsed its wares. However, only 3% said they had themselves bought and used drugs from the site – though a similar number had taken drugs a friend had bought on Silk Road.Wider drug dealing online happens with less rigorous secrecy than the hi-tech (but hard to use) Silk Road. Instead, it relies on obscure coded listings hidden among job adverts, private sales and suspiciously cheap properties to let – \"flat for rent – £60 – ask for Charlie\".\"\n",

Otherwise you'll upload your signature to a key server! This is the offline equivalent of updating every phone book directory in the world with legally binding evidence you know DPR's phone number. In addition this would reveal your IP address unless your copy of GPG is setup to route its communications via Tor).So, if you go to the keychain where the big list of public keys is on the GPA, you find the public key you want to sign, and then you right click and select Sign Locally. Then verify the signed PGP text again. It shall come up as \"Valid\".Edit: fatoldsun's method shall work just as well as the above. Indeed using the command line or terminal is often preferable because it always works the same way over time and there's usually no difference between different operating systems.Edit 2: Some people are saying that the \"sign locally\" option isn't there in the GPA. It does exist, it just may be hidden away someplace, you'll have to hunt it down in the options somewhere. Alternatively use a less awkward piece of GPG software or use oldfatsun's method.Different PGP implementations handle these things differently. To be honest I think this web of trust concept has been implemented poorly, it's a complete cock up from an anonymity standpoint. The designers of PGP should have been thinking about how to make the difference between \"authentication use\" and \"anonymous use\" of PGP very clear to the user, because it is not obvious in the least.Quote from: C20H25N3O on May 06, 2013, 09:50 amThank you very much pine!All of your posts are pricelessQuote from: TurpenT on May 06, 2013, 06:51 pmPine is a god/dess to this forum.

Also quit trolling poor dbelle Mr Razorspyne ;)Note: There is usually no good reason to indicate a URL is clearnet or darknet. Any \"clearnet\" links should be browsed with Tor just like you do with a hidden service like this one.I never understood why anybody did this in the first place.  Surely you'd be able to figure it out from it not ending with .onion, right?Some people think that they're \"on Tor\" when they access hidden services and otherwise not. It's good to be conservative with these things if you don't know, but it is still the wrong model.I have also talked to people who go to the other extreme and think everything is Torified if they are running the TBB e.g. torrents, regular internet browser etc. Exceptions like Liberte and Tails confuse people unintentionally.What it comes down to I suppose, is that not everybody knows what an IP address is so they start making assumptions.--For the record, you're on Tor 100% of the time if you're using the TBB, whether .com or .onion, otherwise outside the Tor Browser Bundle you are not unless you explicitly configure other applications to be on Tor on your computer. \n",

      "Quote from: OzFreelancer on June 05, 2013, 07:28 amI recently did an interview where I was asked what I considered were the greatest threats to SR users.  I gave the usual answers, but later I realised that there was one I missed.  This post, and StExo's sticky analysis, confirm it.When SR began, it was small and only the most tech-savvy and security-conscious people accessed it.  But in the past two years, it has been given so much mainstream media (yes, I realise that includes some of my articles) and has become so simple to access, looks so professional and is discussed so openly, I think a bunch of people honestly believe they're not doing anything \"that\" illegal.  After all, if it were that bad, it wouldn't be so easy to do, right?  It's a bit like downloading stuff from Pirate Bay - technically you can go to jail for it, but how often does that happen, right?Either that, or people are deluded that it is \"click-and-go\" safe and they don't REALLY need to go to the extra effort to learn PGP or take other precautions that were once no-brainers. After all, if it were dangerous, heaps more people would have been caught.  LE are powerless, right? You can taunt them and there's nothing they can do!But drug use is much less accepted by the mainstream majority than pirating the odd movie. And using the site is only 'safe' when all of the anonymity precautions are rigorously adhered to.  And whilst LE may direct resources elsewhere when a market is operating quietly and off the radar, they will throw a ton at it if you start sticking your finger up at them.I think we will be seeing a lot more arrests due to these two types of complacency from users.  Or the security-conscious will simply migrate somewhere safer.Anyone who thinks our enemies are sitting idly by twiddling their thumbs totally befuddled about what to do re SR is living in a fantasy world. This place is a massive fuck you to the systems of coercion and control so poking the bear is definitely NOT a good idea.With regards to people finding this place and having absolutely ZERO consideration for their personal safety, well all I can say is that I have been absolutely flabbergasted by some of the things I have seen in my time here.The saying \"just because you can doesn't mean you should\" has never rung more true in the sense of downloading Tor and finding a URL. There have been some high profile cases of people busted in AU for SR related activity but in reality it was their IRL activities that brought them to the attention of LEO. I fear we will be seeing a lot more cases of people coming into contact with the CJS as so many people treat this place like eBay doing incredible things like creating market site accounts under their real name and/or user names they use for other internet accounts that pop up in a Google searches.... and that's just for starters... the list just gets scarier as demonstrated in StExo's thread so I'll leave it there for now.\n",

Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these ColoniesFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n",

Because buyers had more reason to trust you and do business with you, and Silk Road finally had a revenue stream to invest in advanced server security and feature development.When we started charging a commission, I just picked a number, something like 5.25%. This was added on to every sale, so that sellers got what they listed the item for and buyers only saw one price. I was hoping this would give me the flexibility to change the commission rate at will without too much fuss from the community, but I soon found that many cared very much about this number, especially when I raised it by 1% to 6.25%.From my perspective, I would like this number to be as high as possible without causing sales to drop for you, but I have no idea where that point is. It could be 5%, 10% or even 20%, I just don't know. I'm not saying we're amazon.com, but they charge a 15% commission on every item plus a flat $1.25 and I think ebay charges something like 13% if you take into account all of their fees.So, my proposal is to run an experiment. We've been tracking sales data very closely for months and we're showing fairly steady linear growth. What I'd like to do is double the commission rate to 12.5% for 1 month and see how sales respond to this. If our rate of growth slows, or even shrinks, then at least we'll know that it is too much and can scale it back, but if it doesn't affect sales, then we'll have doubled our revenue without any major consequence and can start investing in some of our \"back-burner\" projects such as internationalizing the site, developing an api, possibly starting an insurance pool, and getting normal updates and features online faster.This change will begin in 3 days unless I hear an overwhelming number of you respond negatively against it. Thanks for your time and for making Silk Road great :)Best regards,Silk Road staff\"Jan 2012: State of the Road Address http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8397.msg76738#msg76738Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on January 09, 2012, 03:56 am-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1- From it's humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters.  From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome.  Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us.It didn't take long before word got out.  Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement.  But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.  It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.  We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.  A revolution has been born.  So ideally, more participants means more prosperity.  What we've found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.So, we've had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.  One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war.  This is always and ever a top priority.  The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point.  The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few).  And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.This success has in no way made us complacent however.  New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and “finalizing early”, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice.  Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved.First we must deal with trading out of escrow.  Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.  This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system.  Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it.We've worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow.  For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates:eBay     - $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.  The average response looked like this:15% of the first $1011% of $10 - $508.14% of $50 - $2505.6% of $250 - $10003.7% of $1000 - $5000We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:10% of the first $508.5% of $50 - 1506% of $150 - 3003% of $300 - 5002% of $500 - 10001.5% for everything over $1000With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.  Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.  We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.  If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.14

http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8539.0Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on January 10, 2012, 02:17 amThank you everyone for your comments and suggestions.  One suggestion I especially like is the one about commission being affected by trade volume.  To those of you that are either supportive of the change, or have faith in what I am doing regardless of whether you see the point or not, thank you for your support!  I have done everything I can to earn that trust and I cherish it.To those of you chalking my actions up to pure greed and ignoring the context for the changes, I say shame on you.  When have I lied?  When have I cheated or stolen from anyone here?  When have I treated anyone unfairly?  When have I lead you astray?  Why do you turn on me now when I have poured my heart and soul into this community and project?10% on $50 orders?  We are talking about an extra $1.88!  A $10 order?  An extra 38 cents!  Do you think this site built itself?  Do you think it runs itself?  Do you have any clue what goes on behind the scenes to keep this going?  Do you have any idea the risk the people operating this site are taking?  Do you have any clue what we've been through to get here today?  Do you have any clue what it's going to take to get through the next year?Whether you like it or not, I am the captain of this ship.  You are here voluntarily and if you don't like the rules of the game, or you don't trust your captain, you can get off the boat.  For those that stay, we at Silk Road will continue to do everything in our power to keep this market running smoothly and safely, and thank you again for your support!Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on January 11, 2012, 11:16 amTo be honest, I am quite surprised by how negative the responses have been to the State of the Road Address and how little faith you put in me after I feel like I have done so much to deserve it.  I chose the words I wrote in the Address very carefully.  I reviewed it many times.  Every one of them is true, and my sentiment is valid.  Go through and re-read it along with the clarifications.  Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me.  This change IS about scam prevention.  We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams.  We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization.  Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along.We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff.  It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change.  There is lots about this organization that just isn't going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately.  Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else's expense, or the expense of our stated goals.  If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom.  I am greedy for power.  Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs.  If we can get to that world, I can die happy.Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started.  It could literally change the world as we know it.  It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there.  Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world?  Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed?  Why aren't you telling me to raise the commission even further then?  I don't hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods.  I don't hear anyone saying “don't do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we're happy to do our part.”As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision.  Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success.  In that world, Silk Road will be a  shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy.  Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this.  We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever.I don't like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time.  Silk Road NEEDS our support.  It needs everything we have.  The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage.  HELP ME GET US THERE!!!  Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.P.S.Here's another thing that doesn't get said enough:  I love you.  This is the most fun I've ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life.  Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs.  Stand by me as we stand up for ourselves.- Silk Road admin\n",

      "\t\t\t\tLots of speculation about DPR here.  ???I am all for open discussion about changes and how they will effect us, but that is a far cry from some of the shit being talked here.First off who are you to say what DPR should charge for his service? If you don't like it then use a different site. I don't mean this to be rude, but that is the way the free market works. DPR should raise the fees until he doesn't feel it is worth it anymore. When the SR began there were no fees to buy/sell here. Things change. It is his property and by complaining about the commissions you sound like someone who thinks they deserve the work of another man for less then he is willing to agree to.Personally, I like the straightforward way DPR put it over a year and a half ago: \"Whether you like it or not, I am the captain of this ship.  You are here voluntarily and if you don't like the rules of the game, or you don't trust your captain, you can get off the boat.  For those that stay, we at Silk Road will continue to do everything in our power to keep this market running smoothly and safely, and thank you again for your support!\" I believe he is acting the same as he always has. I posted the following in another thread but is sounds like some of you didn't see it. This is some of the history on the topic which I found on the forums. He has always taken it personal when people call him out for being greedy or question his right to set the commission as he sees fit.----\"Silkroad Fees\" from July 2011: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=986.0DPR made the following posts in that thread.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on July 27, 2011, 07:16 amadded to the seller's guide:\"...when pricing your items, be sure to include shipping and handling in the price.  Whatever you set your price at will be your total compensation.  However, your listings will display a price that is higher than the one you set because we add a commission to each listing.  The commission is subject to change, but at the time of this writing it is 6.23%.\"Sorry for the opacity.  I'd like to share with you how I view money, so you can get a better idea of what to expect in regards to the management of Silk Road going forward.Money is a tool, a means to an end.  Our end here at Silk Road is not the accumulation of money, or the comfort and security it brings (not that there's anything wrong with that).  Our end is freedom from tyranny, and secured basic human rights for the people of the world.  As awesome as it is, Silk Road is just the beginning in what will likely be a long journey.  You can count on us to use the wealth created by it responsibly to produce ever more infrastructure and resources toward achieving these goals.  In the end, it won't be about the money, it'll be about what we've all achieved by thinking and acting for ourselves and refusing to compromise.Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on July 27, 2011, 09:34 pmQuote from: joeblow2 on July 27, 2011, 08:17 amWould this mean then that as the volume grows exponentially that there is a good chance that the fees will slide downward; both because of volume and the fact that there will be somewhat less to do in the way of major updates of the board because it will become both highly efficient and more bulletproof over time with each new iteration?  Based on your philosophy of money (the tool part is the same as my own, however I do *love* the creature comforts that come from having it) I would be very interested to hear your answer, even if it is just in a philosophical bent rather than any estimation or indication of future fee structures.  thanks!Not necessarily.  Basically what I'm saying is, MUCH more is possible than just being able to buy drugs freely.  With the revenues from Silk Road (the more the better), we can invest in even more ambitious and revolutionary projects.  Money is a tool, but so is Silk Road.  Our aim is to one day live in a world where we won't need Silk Road, because we won't need to hide anymore.September 2011: What do you think about the new SR SELLER COMMISSION that's coming up?  http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=3415.0\"This is an automated message to all Silk Road sellers:Some of you are just joining us as sellers, others have been here since the beginning.

it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time.  Silk Road NEEDS our support.  It needs everything we have.  The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage.  HELP ME GET US THERE!!!  Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.P.S.Here's another thing that doesn't get said enough:  I love you.  This is the most fun I've ever had and I feel closer

      "Quote from: b999 on July 26, 2013, 01:23 pmSo apart from the four pages of fatalistic whining - is there anything that can be done?  This whole thread reads like a manifesto of \"Why We Should Surrender and Give Up\" more than anything else.I think it's more to do with something no more complicated or sinister than good old fashioned job protection.  I see it every day in the work place - people running around trying to be seen to be 'adding value' or justifying their existence - the more useless they know they are - the more desperate they are to be 'seen' to be doing something, anything.  We've all seen it, we've all seen the workplace clown desperate to look like anything but a clown - even at the expense of everyone else by putting them down or abusing them or whatever.  Competent people just do their job and don't make a big scene about stuff.Drugs are an easy target.  The tax funded DEA's are little more than parasites with a sales target trying to climb their own corporate career ladder by being see to be 'adding value' - so drug users are little more than a performance target to them to get the next promotion.  DEA's are just desperate in this economic climate to be seen to be 'important' so they don't get sacked for the useless clowns they are.  Otherwise they would have a real job doing something actually useful.Similarly with politicians.  If you can't add any real value, like say, God forbid, actually improve lives through education, health or just being a competent operator instead of a fearful incompetent clown - then find an easy target to beat up on and declare a \"Crack Down\".Nothing like a good ol' \"Crack Down\" when you are otherwise completely useless in your job and completely unable to add any real value to society.Perhaps if there was less focus on 'consipiracies' and general whining and more on identifying and exposing root behavioural motivations such as this - which may be no more complicated than basic fearful incompetence or self motivated career ambition - then we may make some progress.I think conspiracy theories are a consipiracy in themselves.  By attributing intelligent coordinated malicious intent - we can easily throw our hands up and say \"oh it's God, the weather, my pet cat\" whatever - anything that tells us we are victims and don't have to do a thing because they are all the bad guys and we're the good guys.Consipiracies, religion, ideology, it's all just intellectual and motivational laziness that lets us sit back with a smug smile thinking we know it all and don't need to lift a finger - because - well - it's the world's fault and nothing to do with us or our inaction.So I think it's little more than a bunch of incompetent lazy losers terrorfied of being found out that they are basically useless so they target drug users to try and make themselves look half useful.  Even more so when the economy and country is turning to shit because you can then say 'hey look over there and not at me being a useless clown'.End result.  America probably has more top secret cleared agents than competent teachers.  So Americans become more stupid every day while incompetent lazy DEA's and politicians happily let you all think it's some 'vast conspiracy' - which they probably find quite flattering considering how useless they know they are.  They may even believe they are 'capable' of a consipiracy which only encourages them more to be incompetent self delusional clowns.Because if the world woke up and realised it really is just run by a bunch of incompetent clowns rather than some 'illuminati' then the world get up off the couch and do put some real effort in to fixing its problems.Like running in elections against these clowns or just exposing them as incompetent clowns.Maybe you all need a dirt file on incompetent 'drug war' politicians like they like to have their 'dirt file' on society and people like you.  Call their bluff.  Destroy their credibility and get them dis-elected or sacked to make way for someone better.But don't always assume these clowns are even remotely capable of 'consipiracies' any more than a circus dancing bear can perform calculus.The BBC isn't as objective as you assert.Firstly, it's a nationalized form of media;Secondly, their published narratives align with the US's puppet media 95% of the time.The war on drugs is about money, the prohibitionists will not go down without a fight.However public opinion is changing rapidly as other members have previously mentioned, in no large part to the internet. I also look back to historical examples for insight into the future. As the 18th Amendment repeal was preceded by NY's states legalization of alcohol, so will the war on cannabis be won after Washington's and Colorado's initiatives. Our country is broke and on the verge of another busting of an economic bubble.Our government's limitus with enforcing arcane drug laws is increasing due to funding.Detroit just went bankrupt and every police officer/city employee lost their pensions....ruminate upon this development for a few...I would also like to comment upon the global banking industry's control of the drug markets' proceeds without government interference. I am wondering if the major public backlash against the \"banksters\" ie... OWS etc...will allow for public change regarding drug decriminalization/legalization we already have Western Democratic examples of their success( Portugal,Switzerland) \n",
      "\t\t\t\n",
      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\tI think one important factor is missing. You are judging this completely on the policies of the US. Many other countries don't feel the same way and wish for legislation to turn over. No other country in the world sees the same kind of income from the drug war as the US does and many are starting the see the vast flaws in this policy. Much of Europe is starting to see some form of decriminalisation take place and even (as most recently) Uruguay and New Zealand are introducing drug legalisation. Many states in the US too are decriminalising cannabis and making medical marijuana available. After this takes place it's not such a leap to psychotherapeutic substances like LSD and MDMA being used in that capacity and an overall change in public attitude. Once other governments start to see the benefits of decriminalisation and legalisation they will follow suit. If enough of Europe has these policies in place, the EU's stance on drugs will change and as a result it will put pressure on the UN to change it's policies. The UN does in fact currently view the War on Drugs as a negative so it won't be difficult to sway their minds.Even if the US holds it's position on the war, the rest of the world will be opposed and if they continue their actions against it in foreign countries these could be seen as actions of (real) war, which the UN would obviously have intervene in. By this time if the US has not already changed it's stance it will have fallen out of favour with the rest of the world, not to mention the fact that if legalisation does come about, the economy of the complying countries would grow (due to both income from taxation and reduction of a number of different areas of their budgets (namely policing and military as I'm guessing the governments would change their foreign policies also to a more peaceful atmosphere), crime would fall as would unemployment rates due to the huge increase jobs available in the drug industry). If the US does not at least witness this and change, they would certainly become a much weaker world power and if the aforementioned war (worse case scenario) were to occur, America would lose and it's government would be forced to comply with UN rulings (and probably sanctions).The war on drugs is coming to an end whether the US likes it or not. They can either choose to hold their positions and get fucked six ways from Sunday or change their policies and set an example for the rest of the world, gaining all of the previous benefits of legalisation and retaining their (admittedly waning) world power status.To all the vendors, I feel for you, the easy (well actually, as I've noticed recently, fairly difficult but at least it's very profitable!) money is coming to an end! However I'm sure your expertise will be needed in the new, legitimate, industry.PS: I'm sorry if these ideas have already been touched upon, it's a long thread with a lot of writing so I skimmed.\n",

      "Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on July 31, 2013, 07:52 amHey everyone...  I apologize for this conflict.  I'd like to briefly explain why BC lost his vending privileges despite being a great vendor in many regards.  The piece of evidence that stood out in my mind that made it clear he had crossed the line and had to lose his privileges, was telling the customer that he had saved his address.  I don't remember the exact quote, but it was something along the lines of I'd be careful messing with an anonymous drug dealer that has your address and is psycho.  Not cool.  That's a veiled threat and everyone knows it, and it's exactly why it is against the rules to save customer addresses.Let me make this clear.  The bar is set HIGH for SR vendors.  You can be great in many ways, but you are expected to follow the few rules I put into place.  Honoring and respecting your customer is in the Seller's Guide, and I take that seriously.  You have to go a long way away from that to do what BC did.That being said, Bruce, I love ya, I'm sorry for your loss, but we had a deal and you broke it and I told you ahead of time what would happen.  It was all in the sellers guide/agreement.  Honestly I hope you will reup your refundable vendor deposit and give it another go on a new account, but if we lost you, then I wish you safe travels.He was never my customer. He sent me his address in a PM unencrypted and unsolicited and I was considering mailing him a bag of fermented human shit and piss to get around any rules preventing me from doing so. Jenkem is drugs and he asked for a sample. I did indeed threaten him, but he sure as hell wasn't a customer. He's a pissant, fuckwit of a mooching bastard who literally is banned from the spare coins thread for begging. He got on my nerves. If it was anyone else he would have gotten treated differently. Considering his buyer history and the way he blatantly violated my terms of service and disrespected me, I told him to fuck himself and was ready to indeed whip up a batch of jenkem on principle and mail it to him. I probably would have had an epiphany at some point in the process and realized that's fucking insane, even for me, and you know, not mail a ticking time bomb of a fermenting bag of jenkem through the postal service. But yeah. I fucked up. I've got the new bond money coming and will try again I guess. He came at me with a spam message, and called me a bitch, a nigger and a pussy. I told him talking shit to an anonymous, psychopathic internet drug dealer is not a good idea, especially after you send him your information. This was indeed a threat, but it's also good life advice. Yet again... semantics, but it's your world DPR. You wrote the rules so arguing you is like arguing with a dictionary. Considering he wasn't a customer I considered leaving the PM in my inbox not saving personal information. Again, fucking semantics. I lost my cool and my seller account over a fucktard. Lesson learned. I violated Silk Road rules. I accept my punishment. I just think it's incredibly retarded to lose seller privileges over a public shaming and running joke. Having brought that upon myself. I feel retarded. Considering I loathe retards, I am now full of self-loathing. Bruce is retard.  :oDropping the subject considering DPR is pretty much my idol. Sorry boss. @Libertas: You were only doing your job, but I think you're a fucking douche. I think you are a turbo, super, mega fucking douchebag.

      "\t\t\t\tIt seems for the past 2 ½ years there has been a great continuity of surprise within the SilkRoad community that we have been around this long and as an older member known through various pseudonyms across time, it is also of great joy to be a spectator in the evolution of this great marketplace and on this, my 1000th post I wish to make my thoughts clear with all who I may be honoured to share them with. It is also remarkable  what has come of the community, being a non-user of drugs myself I originally expected to be an outcast of such a community, a person who just wasn’t part of the heart and soul of the group but now many months and years gone, I feel a great deal of mutual respect amongst many members here and have been honoured to meet the many great minds amongst us, too numerous to fully list, but I am sure upon placing such a notion in your mind you can furnish your own long list of great friends and heroes here.I further wish to express my many orders of gratitude to those who have, with a complete sense of selflessness, sought to further the enlightenment of us all bringing a vast array of skills, ideologies and opinions to a grand table of free exchange in a place where no man, woman or child need be afraid of voicing their thoughts at liberty. Over the years we have seen the world around us crumble as the rights of the individual are eroded away by the indoctrinated dogmatists within our governments across the world and I personally believe that, even though taking drugs can be detrimental, that the freedom as found on SilkRoad can prosper healthy discussion and lead to a safer world because it is apparent, whether you agree or disagree with drugs, that it is the ignorant abuse of drugs that are damaging and not simply the drug itself. Again to name all contributions in the field would be a task too long for one man to complete in a lifetime, but as a specific example I would wish to sing praises to DoctorX who is one of the many medical doctors who come by these forums but who has taken a public stand to support those with questions and offering a full and open service expecting no payment in return when I am sure he could easily just sit home and enjoy his evenings in peace; you sir are part of the great advance in this world and I have no doubt in my mind that your efforts are greatly appreciated by many.As a non-user and a person who up until my late teenage years was under the indoctrination of the state believing all drugs are going to kill you and leave you as a hopeless addict, I find that the privilege of being here is amazing in itself and I think the greatest discovery of all time for me is realising that to change our future, all one must do is change their attitude and whilst we may not be able the choose the cards life will hand to us, we can choose how we play those cards.For all those reading my humble words, I want you to reflect on what we have faced so far, what DPR faces, what the staff, vendors and buyers face all the time who’s adversary is out there constantly prowling our walls and breathing down our necks. We have faced adversity, we have had difficult times in the past and we will have challenges in the future, but this is not the end of our persecution and our fight and so we must fight our enemy with the most powerful weapon which has echoed across times and peoples – that is the power of words. No matter how many men die, are thrown in jail, are persecuted or are silenced, nobody can take away the ideas which bring us together to stand against those enemies and when they break down the fortress doors we still stand together unfazed and ready to protect our beliefs no matter how large or cunning our enemy is. In the words of Peter Marshall, when we long for life without difficulties, remind us that oaks grow strong in contrary winds and diamonds are made under pressure.Today we have learned of the loss of another great hidden service, although not confirmed just yet, it appears that the founder of Freedom Hosting has been arrested and I imagine that with such a service which ran for so long having its security penetrated is a matter we at SilkRoad must also be concerned about and so we must face up to the challenges we now have.  I have no information right now which can point to the technical vulnerability of SilkRoad, that is for the technical boffins to discuss and implement, but I feel we all still have a role in the matter and to bring to the centre stage any arising matters or new information we may find as often it is the users of this forum who are the eyes and ears of the community. Rarely does DPR or other staff stumble upon discoveries themselves without the tip-off or referral from other users and I think the credible threats to SR have been greatly reduced thanks to the vigilant actions of our community.What we must now do is keep looking, remain vigilant in all aspects and ensure community cohesion to continue our current trend of growth and security. We have taken many problems such as the recent DDOS attacks by the horns and wrestled it to the ground. Where once the community was slammed by the media, a new age is upon us where it gives me great pleasure indeed to see the stubbornness of a nonconformist community warmly acclaimed.So long as we keep fighting, the heart and soul of this community will never perish and I hope that in many years, people will look back and remember us. Remember those people who done something different, who stood up for their beliefs and despite having enemies glaring them in the face, they were steadfast. Whatever the future may hold for us all, it has been a pleasure to stand beside you all in this new age and I hope that as we face tomorrow, every challenge given to us is just another hurdle we will overcome because whilst our enemies may continue their agenda of imprisoning innocent people for simply expressing their freedom, they will never be able to silence the idea those people stand for and that we all still stand for – together, as one.~StExo\n",

The code you inject is byte code (regardless of the exploit using javascript!) and thus needs to fit the operating system. Also the flaw isn't necessarily present or exploitable on another operating system. It's even possible that the code works only on specific versions of windows.In simple terms: By using the exploit they \"upload\" a program to your computer and run it. That program isn't a javascript and thus needs to fit the attacked operation system. In the recent case the uploaded program was a \"windows program\" which obviously cannot be run on a linux system. If the exploit worked on linux the uploaded program would just crash your browser.QuoteI have a software firewall that blocks all unknown applications from accessing the internet.

Wrong, that is not sandboxing at all, encrypted drive is mounted wont protect from this sort of attack at all but isolating in a virtual machine properly could and would in most cases, again you have no clue what you are talking about.Quote( both tails and linux are written in unix to our knowledge see below, we have also neglected to mention a few more security measures involving ISP that are quite hard to do with any other o/s other then windows,as it is not mentioned on these forums this is for our own safety:).....)Tails is based on Debian which is a Linux distro, Linux is a Unix like operating system, BSD family is actually Unix based.  Quote\"backdoors\" are also written in linux using unix syntax, this the first thing a hacker will learn to do,so why use any system written in unix as most if not all hackers are extremely well versed in how these operating systems work,their flaws and how to get around them?Unix is not a language that you write things in, there are various linux/unix shells that have scripting languages associated with them, Unix based operating systems are actually considered to be some of the most highly secured (OpenBSD, FreeBSD), Linux operating systems are generally thought to be pretty secure to highly secure as well, almost all attack payloads like this are written in some assembly language and then put into memory and made to execute via a vulnerability in an application (like a buffer overflow in a C program) that is exploited with something like javascript. Quotea viruses main purpose is to replicate itself yes, but it can only do this inside the partition it is infected with this is basic computing knowledge.....What magic property of partitioning makes it so virus cannot spread from one partition to another? There is absolutely nothing that inherently prevents a virus from going to one partition to another, you would need to have some access controls to prevent it from spreading in such a way, or you would need to have real sandboxing, or something else. Saying that a virus cannot spread from one partition to another is about as honest as saying a human cannot jump over an object, it entirely depends on the object, and in many cases a virus will have no trouble infecting files in all partitions. Quotesaying tails is written is in unix more like saying a novel and comic are both written in English do u have any concept of syntax? and how that works? because that statement just shows how little you really know about computing....Saying tails is written in Unix is more like saying something that is retarded, tails is based on Debian and uses the Linux Kernel and is written almost exclusively in C, and Linux is a Unix like operating system it isn't really Unix. Quotelinux and tails are both unix based systems and malicious programs are easily written with the terminal of the operating system so we would say as would anyone else with computing knowledge that u can indeed write \"stuff\" with unix..Tails IS a Linux distro, and neither of them are really Unix based they are Unix like. Look at Wikipedia: BSD = Unix https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution , Linux = Unix Like https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux This exploit was probably written in Emacs or Notepad++. \n",

To do that we use all manner of applications to hide our true identities. This ranges all the way from Tor to vendors using Mylar bags.

For me I'd rather a vendor took longer to send out a package because they had to type in a new address then print it out rather than one that's already loaded into a system. I value security over anything else. I'm trying to reduce risk as much as possible and I buy based on a number of provisos - one of them being that the vendor helps keep my identity anonymous. BG has indicated they value making their job easier at the expense of the buyers anonymity.

      "Quote from: AbuNazir on August 09, 2013, 06:41 amI like how you are framing your argument to suggest viewing CP reduces the amount of sexual abuseI don't need to suggest it studies prove itQuotewhile discounting the fact that the children in the CP are, in fact, being abused.Cerainly many of the children depicted in CP are depicted being abused. However, unless you believe in photographs having magical properties, you must admit that the following logic holds:A. Pictures of Jews being tortured and killed during the holocaust depict genocideB. Viewing pictures of the holocaust is not the same as causing genocide to happenWe can reduce these sentences:A. Pictures of bad thing happening depict bad thingsB. Viewing pictures of bad things happening is not doing bad thingswhich in turn leads to:A. Pictures of children being molested depict child abuseB. Viewing pictures of children being molested is not the same as abusing childrenI would love for you to give a reasonable and intelligent explanation of why this argument by analogy doesn't work, so far nobody has been able to. I am left to conclude that they think pictures of molestation are magic, whereas pictures of other crimes are not. QuoteYou think lawmakers in the US are just going to write those kids off as acceptable losses because you read a research study that claims your ability to view the material makes you less likely to commit the offense yourself? That will NEVER happen in the US. Keep trying to justify yourself, and enjoy the prison rape when you get caught. I hear they give extra attention to the pedos. Well actually you are certainly wrong that this will never happen in the US considering it is already legal to view CP under New York State law:http://jonathanturley.org/2012/05/15/new-yorks-highest-court-rules-that-it-is-not-unlawful-to-view-online-child-pornography/QuoteThe New York Court of Appeals has released an important decision that viewing online child pornography is not illegal under New York law. The ruling has triggered an outcry and demands for legislative reforms. However, the opinion is worth reading and raises a broader issue on the required level of intent and knowledge for these crimes.The decision will result in the reversal of two dozen cases involving online pornography. The case before the Court involved former Marist College professor of public administration James D. Kent, 65. Kent who was convicted on 136 counts of procuring and possessing child pornography in 2009. He was sentenced to one to three years.The case raises an issue that we have discussed previously on how prosecutors pile on counts of child pornography based on each image. However, these cases often involve the download of hundreds or thousands of images in a single click. I have seen cases where a couple of downloads involved a few pictures found to be child pornography and led to charges. In Kent’s case, he was found to have downloaded and then deleted files containing images of children.Appellate Senior Judge Carmen Beauchamp Ciparick wrote a majority opinion for four of the six judges.Advocates are calling the ruling an “outrage” and the “decriminalizing” of child pornography. However, Ciparick’s decision simply emphasized conventional notions of scienter: “Merely viewing Web images of child pornography does not, absent other proof, constitute either possession or procurement within the meaning of our Penal Law.”The case did not involve just a couple of images, making the choice of this appeal more interesting. However, Kent insisted that he was “doing research” on child pornography:    The allocated space on defendant’s hard drive also contained a “My Documents” folder with subfolders labeled “cdocs” and another labeled “work,” and an additional folder labeled “JK.” The “cdocs” subfolder contained approximately 13,000 saved images of female children, whom Investigator Friedman estimated to be 8 or 9 years old, dressed in lingerie or bathing suits and many with their legs spread open. The “work” subfolder contained an additional 17,000 saved images of female children, some organized into further subfolders named for a particular child. The JK folder held a file labeled “porndef.pb,” which contained a document that included the text of four messages dated between June 1999 and July 2000 and directed to the unidentified recipient “P.B.”1 The messages apparently relate to a potential research project on the regulation of child pornography and include comments such as “sooner or later someone at this college is going to wonder why I keep looking at porno sites.” A final message dated July 11, 2001 states:    “Well, this last batch pretty much tears it. While, as somebody’s father, I’m pretty appalled by this stuff, I also don’t want to get arrested for having it. So let’s do this—if this is a legitimate research project, let’s write it up and tell the deans (and preferably also the cops) what we’re doing and why. Otherwise, let’s drop it in the most pronto possible fashion.    “I don’t even think I can mail the disk to you, or anyone else, without committing a separate crime. So I’ll probably just go ahead and wipe them. You have the URL’s if you want to pursue it.    “See you sooner or later, no doubt. Kent.”The Court however was concerned (as are many civil libertarians) with how courts have been treating access and downloading of images as proof of intent. With surfing on the web, the concern is that images can be accessed without knowing before hand that they are child pornography. This may not be the strongest such case for the defense but the concern is a valid one:    Like the federal courts to address the issue, we agree that where no evidence shows defendant was aware of the presence of the cached files, such files cannot underlie a prosecution for promotion or possession. This is necessarily so because a defendant cannot knowingly acquire or possess that which he or she does not know exists (see United States v Kuchinski, 469 F3d 853, 863 [2006] [to prosecute a defendant who lacks knowledge about the cache for possession of files stored therein \"turns abysmal ignorance into knowledge and a less than valetudinarian grasp into dominion and control\"]).    However, cached images can serve as evidence of defendant’s prior viewing of images that were, at one time, resident on his computer screen. Such evidence, like a pattern of browsing for child pornography, is relevant to the mens rea of both crimes by showing that a defendant did not inadvertently access an illicit image or site or was not mistaken as to its content.    Nonetheless, that such images were simply viewed, and that defendant had the theoretical capacity to exercise control over them during the time they were resident on the screen, is not enough to constitute their procurement or possession. We do not agree that “purposefully making [child pornography] appear on the computer screen — for however long the defendant elects to view the image — itself constitutes knowing control” . . . Rather, some affirmative act is required (printing, saving, downloading, etc.) to show that defendant in fact exercised dominion and control over the images thatThe question comes down to whether there was proven intent and proven possession in the case. In the concurrence by Judge Smith, the dangers of a broad interpretation of the criminal law (as advocated by another judge) was discussed:    Judge Graffeo Click for Enhanced Coverage Linking Searches argues, in substance, that we can best effectuate the Legislature’s intention by reading the statutes expansively, to include as many “consumers” as the statutory language can reasonably be interpreted to permit. I do not agree.    Under Judge Graffeo Click for Enhanced Coverage Linking Searches’s reading, someone who does no more than click on a link for the purpose of looking at a pornographic picture for free — someone [*22] who has never interacted with a child victim, has never copied, downloaded or saved a pornographic picture of a child, and has never put a penny in the pocket of a child pornographer — is subject to up to seven years in prison for a first offense (see Penal Law § 70.00 [2] [d]). This is surely a stringent punishment for someone whom many would think more pathetic than evil. Nor can we safely assume that bringing as many consumers as possible within the reach of the law is the most effective way to lessen or eliminate the trade: A policy of draconian enforcement directed at the most minor and peripheral of users is perhaps no more likely to eliminate child pornography than a similar policy would be to eliminate illegal drugs.One can certainly argue both sides of this question, but the vitriol and hatred directed at these judges is unwarranted and unfair. These judges are not pro-child pornography any more than the vast majority of citizens. They are attempting to maintain basic requirements of intent and proof in an area where politicians have been competing to show that they are the toughest on child porn. These are legitimate concerns raised by these judges, who voted to reverse despite the considerable public pressures and passions.QuoteDo you think rape porn makes you less likely to rape someone? Nope. Do you think that people who have rape fantasies are interested in actually raping others, or in being raped themselves? That seems unlikely considering rape is the third most popular female fantasy: http://www.care2.com/causes/rape-ranked-as-third-most-popular-sexual-fantasy-for-women.htmlQuoteYou are watching it because it sexually excites you. Whether or not you act on that impulse isn't related to your ability to find the porn on the internet and beat off to it. Your logic is flawed. This is all nothing new. Child molesters will ALWAYS try to justify themselves to normal people and we will keep locking you up in prison. I am sure you feel justified talking about it on a site like this since drugs are illegal too, but there is a big difference in an adult making a choice to take a drug and an adult raping a defenseless child.Do you think 50% of the world is not normal? Because in 50% of the world PEOPLE DO NOT GET LOCKED UP for looking at CP or even downloading it. In 50% you can download it legally, in over 50% you can view it on the internet if you don't save a collection of it.\n",

So should we try you for war crimes? The debate isn't that it should be legal to abuse children and photograph it, primarily it is that it is not bad to look at or possess images.Most CP is snuff / rape footage.  If you were ass-raped by your dad as a kid, would you think it was okay for all of us to watch that?  Don't even answer, because there is only one answer.I'm all for saying 'fuck sensitivity', but you're debating the morality of the existence of child rape as something that is \"okay to watch\", so long as you didn't commit it.  But if you're watching it, aren't you fantasizing?  Isn't that what we do when we watch adult porn?  Wherever your mind is, it's not a good place guy.As someone who has a great amount of CP for shock value in my early teens, I call bullshit on what you are saying. Most CP is by dickless freaks being weird cunts, and as someone molested I spent half my life just wishing someone fucked me properly. Most pedophiles love kids, and do weird shit instead of real sex, alienating children sexually. You could castrate them, but they don't even need an erection.

Doesn't that mean you think a thought should be illegal? So you are in favor of thought police?Are you in favor of destroying personal privacy?  This is a double edged sword.  You're defending the pedophiles right to whack off to a picture of a naked preteen, but you're disregarding that preteen's human right to not be taken advantage of, made a mockery or plaything of, and exposed to a twisted fucks of parents who were willing to sell their child, or market them off to the underground CP industry...                    Anyway, if you continue to argue, you'll be doing it with yourself.  You're really not worth the time spent already in this thread.Quote from: KintaroBC on August 09, 2013, 07:19 amQuote from: Praetorian on August 09, 2013, 07:08 amQuote from: kmfkewm on August 09, 2013, 07:02 amQuote from: KintaroBC on August 09, 2013, 07:00 amChildren don't have reason, they can't consent to their sexual imagery.I'm sick of this retarded discussion.

So should we try you for war crimes? The debate isn't that it should be legal to abuse children and photograph it, primarily it is that it is not bad to look at or possess images.Most CP is snuff / rape footage.  If you were ass-raped by your dad as a kid, would you think it was okay for all of us to watch that?  Don't even answer, because there is only one answer.I'm all for saying 'fuck sensitivity', but you're debating the morality of the existence of child rape as something that is \"okay to watch\", so long as you didn't commit it.  But if you're watching it, aren't you fantasizing?  Isn't that what we do when we watch adult porn?  Wherever your mind is, it's not a good place guy.As someone who has a great amount of CP for shock value in my early teens, I call bullshit on what you are saying. Most CP is by dickless freaks being weird cunts, and as someone molested I spent half my life just wishing someone fucked me properly. Most pedophiles love kids, and do weird shit instead of real sex, alienating children sexually. You could castrate them, but they don't even need an erection.

      "QuoteYou are supporting rape for profit.How is it supporting rape for profit to look at a picture for free without paying for it? Where is the profit? QuoteWe might never win a war on pedophilia and child abuse but it is like the war on murder, just because it can't be won doesn't mean that murdering people or raping kids should ever be OK.Nice strawman, I never said that raping kids should be okay. I don't know why everybody always tries to change the subject to raping kids, who is even talking about raping kids? I am talking about looking at pictures. QuoteYour 50% statistics are bullshit. You are telling me that if you randomly pick 2 people from anywhere on this planet at least one of them would support your right to view child-abuse material? My 50% statistics have had two citations given for them already, and I was talking about number of countries in the world where it is legal to view CP try to work on your reading comprehension a little. QuoteBullshit, it wouldn't even be 1% and if anything the number of people who are OK with child abuse is decreasing with the increase around the world in women's education and children's rights in developing countries. Just because certain third-world and developing nations haven't specifically criminalized child porn yet doesn't mean they are OK with it. I guarantee in 99% of these places no law has ever been created, it is not a case of it becoming legalized and legislated.I never claimed to be okay with child abuse, I understand that you have a mental disorder that makes you incapable of telling different things apart, but let me try to explain this very clearly. Child abuse is bad, looking at pictures of abused children is not child abuse. Holocaust is bad, looking at pictures of the holocaust is not genocide. Almost all of south America has little to no laws regarding child porn possession, it is nice to know you think that they are all third world. Same with Russia, same with Japan. Japan is one of the most developed countries in the world dumbass, and they have specifically rejected proposals to make child porn illegal to possess even after being under international pressure to do so. QuoteThis isn't like taking drugs where the harm comes almost entirely from it's criminalization, you are talking about a market that revolves around non-consensual abuse of minors. You can tell yourself in your head as much as you like that you aren't the one harming children so you aren't doing the wrong thing if that makes you feel better, but you are viewing material in which children are systematically abused for your benefit, it is because of people like you that this filth is being created. I don't necessarily think you should be locked up for the rest of your life, but you definitely need some psychological treatment.There is no harm created by viewing child porn. The harm was already created to produce the child porn. If I look at a picture it has no effect on anybody other than me. Nobody other than me even has to know that I looked at a picture. You think that there is some magical process involved, something that nobody can identify but just is. You are no different from a religious person, you have faith that viewing child porn causes children to be abused but you cannot give any evidence for this, you cannot explain a mechanism of action that I cannot immediately shoot down. You believe in child pornography viewing causing damage to children much how Christians believe that Jesus rose from the dead. No amount of research and science is going to convince you otherwise, just as no Christian is likely to be convinced against their faith. QuoteYour argument is just like saying that if I find an unconscious girl and rape her with a condom and don't leave any marks and she doesn't find out then I haven't done anything wrong because she hasn't been harmed. That argument is essentially saying that when a photograph of a person is taken they exist in the photograph. Dude, Harry Potter is fiction, I hope you know that. If you find an unconscious girl and take her pants off and take pictures of her, then yeah you did something bad and should be punished. If I look at the pictures you took, I don't think I did anything bad. I had no effect on that girl, you caused something to happen to her. QuoteYou obviously need some psychological treatment, I think you are right that most pedophiles are less than average intelligence because you are missing the essential point of the argument: JUST BECAUSE YOU DIDN'T RAPE THE CHILD YOURSELF DOESN'T MEAN YOU AREN'T DOING THE WRONG THING BY PARTICIPATING IN A MARKET IN WHICH CHILDREN ARE SYSTEMATICALLY RAPED FOR PROFIT.Well first off I am not a pedophile I am more like a non-exclusive ephebephile I would say. Second off, I never said it should be legal to buy child pornography. You are delusional if you think there is a big child porn market, all of those got shut down years ago. Almost all child porn is freely traded on P2P networks and in various forum communities. Nobody pays for shit, nobody profits off of shit. Sure there are some small non-organized cases where individuals may make some profit, but to think of child porn as primarily a for profit market phenomenon is just deluding yourself. When people download music and videos off of P2P networks are they supporting the for profit market for music and videos? Pretty sure they are certainly not supporting it at best, and hurting it at worst. QuoteMy view is that society says that it's wrong to abuse kids and the argument that sacrificing a few to the abusers may stop more being abused doesn't wash.  As for viewing it, if there wasn't a market for this it wouldn't be so readily available and therefore a lot of the for profit vids would never be made.  I'm not in the hang-em-high camp and am pretty cool with most consensual perversions with consenting adults but the key here is consent.  Just because a child has been groomed to think abuse is natural and welcome is not consent and the damage done, and the damage those children go on to do (apparently there's a large proportion of abusers who were abused as a child), is unacceptable in any civillised country.There isn't much of a market for it. Do you think there is a \"market\" for freely downloaded videos and music from P2P networks? Anyway I never said it should be legal to pay for CP, only to view it and possess it. Also you seem to , like most others here, incorrectly think that I am saying it should be legal to abuse kids. No, I didn't say that, I said it should be legal to look at and possess any information. Quote But then you contradict your own argument by saying \"I'm not saying CREATING should be legal, just VIEWING\" ... Again, we get it... Censorship violates our right to 'Freedom' ... How does that contradict my own argument?QuoteLegalizing the view of CP would be only be funding the people CREATING IT.  Stop being so narrow-minded. Legalizing the purchase of CP would fund the people creating it for profit (all 15 of them), but in reality 99.999% of people busted with CP have never paid for it. This is another reason why in more modern times the laws against CP make less and less sense. When CP was first made illegal, 99.999% of people who had it paid for it from studios that existed for the entire purpose of creating CP. People were like WTF we must make this illegal, the Supreme Court agreed blah blah blah. Fast forward about 50 years and the situation is almost exactly the opposite. The last big production studios doing the for profit model got shut down in the early 2000's, the last known large scale commercial CP distributor got busted several years ago. Today 99.9999% of CP offenders do not pay for CP, they download it mostly from P2P programs, they don't communicate with other offenders or network. All they do is go to a P2P network , download some pictures and view them in the privacy of their home. Nobody knows they downloaded these pictures, the child doesn't know they downloaded these pictures, the person who molested the child doesn't know they downloaded these pictures, they did not support any market for CP and they did not create a demand that is even identified by anybody in most cases. They are very close to looking at a picture in a vacuum, and yet you want still to say that this should be illegal. QuoteIt was YOU who compared the Legalization of Drugs to Legalization of CP.  But when they 'legalize' drugs, they also 'regulate' them.  I have not seen one argument or position stating the plan, or effectiveness of any 'regulation' of CHILD porn.  Because why?  BECAUSE YOU CANNOT REGULATE CHILD MOLESTATION AND RAPE.For the I don't know how many-th time , I do not support or think child molestation or rape should be legal. I think it should be legal to look at pictures. I don't think it needs to be regulated. I don't think drugs need to be regulated. I don't feel the need to have a bunch of government thugs tell me what I can do. \n",

      "\n",
      "\t\t\t\tLet's start from your initial point:A new study from the Czech Republic claims that the availability of child pornography has led to lower rates of child abuse.  This result allegedly is consistent with similar observations in Denmark, Germany, Finland, Sweden and the USA.  Here’s the research’s crux:The findings support the theory that potential sexual offenders use child pornography as a substitute for sex crimes against children. While the authors do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography, they say that artificially produced materials might serve a purpose.The inference to be drawn from this research is that legalizing and further increasing child pornography’s availability would decrease the incidence of child abuse.  The problem with these studies, and from which this one does not seem to be immune, is that there is no control for alternate or outside variables.  This research shows a correlation between availability of child porn – despite its illegality in most nations – and the decrease in child abuse, but ignores other explanations and ultimately cannot establish a causal relationship.This leads the critical reader to a disturbing place: What content competes with child pornography?  For one, there’s the entire genre of “barely legal” porn – just do a search for “teen” and the market’s representation is readily apparent.  We don’t care or pass judgment on any kind of porn, so long as its made by consenting adults, but it seems far-fetched to think that its producers aren’t at least cognizant of the child porn market when they specialize in cheerleader themes, models in braces, and pigtails.  To their credit, they are providing a legal alternative and monetizing a market segment that can otherwise ruin lives if handled irresponsibly.There is also the existence of virtual child pornography.  In 2002, the Free Speech Coalition won a decisive victory for expression over the DOJ in Free Speech Coalition v. Ashcroft, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. §§ 2256(8)(B) and (D) were unconstitutionally overbroad, as their prohibitions on virtual child pornography and production or distribution of material pandered as child pornography – even if it is not – captured speech that was not unprotected within the scope of its earlier decisions in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (defining the test for obscenity) or New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (allowing states to ban child pornography sales, as it was not protected speech).  While undoubtedly a small market – and one I have no interest in personally investigating – this allowance for computer-generated images and other “virtual” child pornography displaces the demand for actual child pornography, yet may contribute to the overall decline in child abuse crimes.Other possible reasons for the decreased incidence of child abuse despite increased child pornography availability may be more related to features of criminal law rather than the adult marketplace or First Amendment doctrines.  First, state and federal laws may have become stricter against child offenses, inhibiting child abuse despite the availability of child pornography.  20 years ago, implementing a ubiquitous data repository for every sex offender to be mapped out like many states have done under their respective Megan’s Law provisions, as the internet was not available.  But today, those databases are active and seemingly everywhere, ruining lives while providing dubious benefits to public safety.  Depending on the relevant state’s laws, viewing child pornography may carry a lesser prison sentence than actually touching a child, and be the economically efficient choice on that basis.  Because fulfilling one’s desire is going to result in penalties and sex offender registration either way, a rational pedophile is going to choose the path that costs him the least amount of his life behind bars.  Furthermore, downloading child porn is more likely to put him into a federal prison upon conviction or reaching a plea deal – a depressing place, but far preferable to many state prisons.  Another reason for this perceived decline in child abuse is simply that reporting it has gone down.  With families more broken than ever in recent history, do parents care, and do their children even tell them if they were molested?Ignoring these covariants and assuming the relationship between child porn availability and child abuse is causative, everyone from social scientists and policy-makers to parents is left with significant moral questions: Is it preferable to end child pornography so that the actors are not abused if it comes at the expense of the broader child population?  Or is it preferable that the actors suffer so fewer random children are victimized?  Ultimately this is a moral and ethical question that could be resolved with further research, but cannot be conclusively “answered” with any empirical truth.  Ultimately, society does not tolerate child abuse.  While the age of consent is an arbitrary line, the asymmetries of power and knowledge between adults and minors, wherever the line is drawn, makes preying on the young, the weak, the naive and inexperienced, so abhorrent.  Even if a 16-year-old is capable of forming subjective consent, the line is drawn at 18 (for production purposes) because, well, the line has to be drawn somewhere.Should a causative or at least highly correlative relationship between child pornography and child abuse in fact exist, it would not be the first time such a finding was made.  In a study tracking rape data from 1980 to 2000, there was a .95 r^2 correlation between internet access and per capita incidence of rape; in the four states where internet access was highest, rapes per capita fell 27%; the four states with the least internet availability saw the per capita incidence of rape increase 53%.  Granted, this study as well was subject to the covariants I mentioned above, as the states with highest internet access (New York and California, among others) tend to be the most liberal and presumably disinclined to rape, but a .95 r^2 is damn high.  If not causative, it at least suggests that pornography was a meaningful substitute for sex among potential rapists.  Where pornography was not available, the incidence of rape increased, and porn’s inaccessibility very likely was a factor.  At the very least, it controverts the feminist claptrap that sex is about power — wrong, sugar: It’s about sex.  This consideration is orthogonal to the Czech Republic study, though, as it does not address child pornography and the important social, legal and political issues it entails.  Virtually nobody objects to consenting adults filming their sex acts; nobody can ignore the problems presented when children are involved with sexual content.http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-child-pornography-laws.html  - This wasn't the article I saw earlier, but this clearly defines the current illegality of possessing and view Child Porn.  --  \"New York also prohibits the promotion and possession of an obscene sexual performance by a child. Section 235 of the Penal Code defines material or performance meeting the following three requirements as \"obscene\": (1) the average person, applying contemporary community standards, would find that its \"predominant appeal is to the prurient interest in sex\"; (2) it depicts actual or simulated sexual intercourse or other sexual conduct in a \"patently offensive manner\"; and (3) considered as a whole, it lacks serious literary, artistic, political, and scientific value. Penalties for promotion and possession offenses do not vary depending on the obscene or non-obscene nature of the material in question. - See more at: http://statelaws.findlaw.com/new-york-law/new-york-child-pornography-laws.html#sthash.35P3i2ko.dpuf\"And...QuoteA longitudinal study of 341 convicted child molesters in America found that pornography's use correlated significantly with their rate of sexually re-offending. Frequency of pornography use was primarily a further risk factor for higher-risk offenders, when compared with lower-risk offenders, and use of highly deviant pornography correlated with increased recidivism risk for all groups.[5] The majority of men who have been charged with or convicted of child pornography offenses show pedophilic profiles on phallometric testing.[6] A study with a sample of 201 adult male child pornography offenders using police databases examined charges or convictions after the index child pornography offense(s). 56% of the sample had a prior criminal record, 24% had prior contact sexual offenses, and 15% had prior child pornography offenses. One-third were concurrently charged with other crimes at the time they were charged for child pornography offenses. 17% of the sample offended again in some way during this time, and 4% committed a new contact sexual offense. Child pornography offenders with prior criminal records were significantly more likely to offend again in any way during the follow-up period. Child pornography offenders who had committed a prior or concurrent contact sexual offense were the most likely to offend again, either generally or sexually.And this...QuoteThe treatment of children as sexual objects has existed through the ages, and so too has the production of erotic literature and drawings involving children. However, pornography in the modern sense began with the invention of the camera in the early nineteenth century. Almost immediately, sexualized images involving children were produced, traded, and collected.  Even so, child pornography remained a restricted activity through most of the twentieth century. Images were usually locally produced, of poor quality, expensive, and difficult to obtain. The relaxation of censorship standards in the 1960s led to an increase in the availability of child pornography, and, by 1977, some 250 child pornography magazines were circulating in the United States, many imported from Europe.  Despite concern about the extent of child pornography, law enforcement agencies had considerable success in stemming the trafficking of these traditional hard-copy forms. However, the advent of the Internet in the 1980s dramatically changed the scale and nature of the child pornography problem, and has required new approaches to investigation and control.And this...QuoteAccording to the Mayo Clinic of the U.S.A., studies and case reports indicate that 30% to 80% of individuals who viewed child pornography and 76% of individuals who were arrested for Internet child pornography had molested a child, however they note that it is difficult to know how many people progress from computerized child pornography to physical acts against children and how many would have progressed to physical acts without the computer being involved.            *Mayo Clinic is a not-for-profit medical practice and medical research group based in Rochester, Minnesota. It is the first and largest integrated not-for-profit medical group practice in the world, employing more than 3,800 physicians and scientists and 50,900 allied health staff.[1][2] The practice specializes in treating difficult cases through tertiary care. It spends over $500 million a year on research.Mayo Clinic has been near the top of the U.S. News & World Report List of \"Best Hospitals for more than 20 years\".[3] The practice is distinguished by integrated care. It has been on the list of America's \"100 Best Companies to Work For\" published by Fortune magazine for eight years in a row.[4][5]And this...Quote You're just wrong.  \n",

      "Quote from: Hungry ghost on August 10, 2013, 09:48 amSo, abusing children is wrong, but looking at pictures of people abusing children isn't? But how can you have one without the other? How can you have banks without bank robbery? How can you have humans without murder? Should we ban banks to get rid of bank robbery? Should we ban humans to get rid of murder? Saying we must ban looking at child pornography to get rid of producing child pornography is as absurd as saying these other things.QuoteHow can you engage in your harmless picture viewing without a child being abused?You cannot engage in harmless picture viewing without a child being abused (ignoring jailbait and nudist stuff). But there is something called an arrow of time. It moves forward. Children have already been abused in the past. Not looking at the pictures of the abuse makes them no less abused. The thing to look at here is cause and effect. You can engage in picture viewing without causing a child to be abused. QuoteThis personal freedom you are trying to defend only makes sense if you refuse to think about the whole chain of events. Yes, by viewing the picture you are not directly causing abuse, but its iimpossible for you to view the picture without that abuse taking place. (leaving aside drawings or convincing child robots)So what it is impossible for somebody to look at a picture without the abuse depicted in the picture having taken place? The abuse already took place! Not looking at the picture doesn't make it go away. I am thinking about the whole chain of events, I think you might not be thinking about the order of events. QuoteYou keep gloating about the logical fallacies others are committing in this thread, in the grip of the strong emotions child abuse engenders. But you are flinging them out left right and centre. In particular, the argument you keep falling back on seems very much a false analogy:      Child abuse is wrong >>>>so viewing pictures of it is wrong             Robbing banks is wrong>>>>so viewing pictures of robbery is wrong       The Holocaust is wrong>>>>so viewing pictures of it is wrong.      (Reducing to absurdity, showing the premise of an argument leads to absurd conclusions)       The key difference here is that people aren't robbing banks with the aim of making videos to share with fellow bank robbers, and egging each other on. The Holocaust wasn't committed with the aim of sharing the footage with other totalitarian states \"hey Stalin check this out LOL\"It is an irrelevant difference. All are victim creating crimes and all are pictures of crimes with victims depicted. The analogy is solid. Quote You are also muddying the water somewhat with talk of 14 year old ages of consent, and sexually mature teenagers. This is a completely seperate issue from paedophilia. Throughout most of history a girl was considered a woman when she reached sexual maturity (ie began menstruating). However for legal purposes we find it necessary to draw a line, in most states either 14 or 16. In most cases courts will deal much more leniently with a 17 year old who has had sex with a 14 year old, than a 30 year old who did the same. This seems fair enough to me.Seems more fair to me to lower the age of consent to something more reasonable. Some countries already have! A lot of them are even first world and highly populated :D. QuoteI agree that there is a huge amount of media and societal hysteria about paedophilia, (watch Chris Morris's Brasseye episode about \"paedogeddon\" for a funny take on this). I get that not all people that view CP are child murderering monsters, or even child molesters.Hell, even most of the inflated bullshit statistics from the crusaders agree that the majority of people viewing child porn are not child molesters and are not risks to children. Quote     The study you cite (\"dozens\" showing no correlation between legalising porn and increased sex crime, ONE showing the same for CP, the Czech one) seems kind of weak. Statistics from 1945-1989, then after 1989? Did any other major changes take place in Czech society between these two periods, that might affect a) the data and b) how the data was collected? On the internet, its fairly easy to find research that backs any position you care to take.  I don't think its clear whether the availability of CP effects the incidence of child abuse either way. I really don't think you can claim the evidence on your side, as you have done, several times in this thread, saying things along the lines of 'if you support restriction of CP you are actually increasing child abuse'. It is not a single one showing the link with CP and reduced sex abuse of minors, also Japan and many other countries as well. Sure can find citations for either argument, I can also find instances where the people arguing the other way have fabricated data and published fraudulent documents so I know who to trust.      QuoteYou keep hitting the same argument, looking at a picture of as crime is not the same as committing it. Sure, but when producing the pictures of the crime is a major motivation for the crime, the viewer is complicit. Although in a significant number of cases I imagine that producing pictures of the crime is a major motiviation (for example all of the commercial CP), I think that in a significant number of the cases producing a picture of the crime is a secondary motivation. Most people do not molest children just so they can take pictures of it, they molest children because they want to molest children and they take pictures of it because they can. And in any case, it is irrelevant. QuoteIf you watch it, you are complicit in its production. that makes as much sense as saying if I look at pictures of the holocaust I am complicit in genocide. If somebody looks at a picture of a child being abused so fucking what they had nothing to do with it, probably didn't pay for it, probably nobody even knows they did it. how the fuck is that complicit in the production of it? Quote Complicit: Associated with or participating in a questionable act or a crime So if it is the watching of the crime that makes someone complicit, then my argument about the holocaust stands. If you say that somebody participates in the crime by looking at pictures of it, then you are probably insane. QuoteYes, yes I know \"huh? So if I watch a film of a bank robbery I'm complicit in that too am I?\". No. These are two different situations as outlined above. The demand for the CP encourages the supply. This demand need not be monetary. I already have given citations that there is no evidence for this, but I know you think citations to things on the internet are useless. Okay I have a proposal then. There is a technology called private information retrieval. It lets somebody get an item from a set of databases without the set of databases being able to tell the item they got out of it. If we have a bunch of databases containing CP and various other items, and people use PIR to get items out of the database, then nobody can determine the demand for any of the individual items in the database. This effectively completely hides the demand for any of the individual items in the database. Do you think that if CP is only legal to view if it is obtained from a PIR system that it is okay? Because that handles the demand problem perfectly, nobody will know the demand for child pornography and you cannot use it as your reason to argue against it if it is only distributed via PIR. QuoteSo, non exclusive ephebephile? You like dem young girls? But you'll take a grown up lady if that's all that's going? Well I guess we can all understand that. But, where do we draw the line? In our society we regard girls under 16, although their bodies (their nubile soft young bodies.....) might be physically mature, as too young to give meaningful consent, and so they fall under the protection of the law, against exploitation. Obviously, on her 16 th  birthday, a girl doesn't suddenly change from a child into a woman, but we need these legal fictions for practical reasons.Well I am pretty clearly attracted to girls at age 14, really I could probably even go somewhat lower than that on a case by case basis. I have no interest at all in anybody who is not at all sexually developed, so I do not qualify as being a pedophile. I am interested in females between tanner stage 4 and 5 I would say, which can range from 13 to indefinite age (some females never even get to stage 5). I don't feel such strong compulsion to have sex with any particular age group that I would bother trying to do anything illegal like sleeping with underage teenagers (not going to find me on to catch a predator, lol), and I still wonder at what age it is okay to have sex with somebody without causing them harm. I really doubt that age is 16 or 18 personally. QuoteAh fuck it....I'm just going to call you a nonce like everyone else.

Research has long established that teens who watch movies or listen to music that glamorizes drinking, drug use or violence tend to engage in those behaviors themselves. A 2012 study shows that movies influence teens’ sexual attitudes and behaviors as well. The study, published in Psychological Science, found that the more teens were exposed to sexual content in movies, the earlier they started having sex and the likelier they were to have casual, unprotected sex.In another study, boys who were exposed to sexually explicit media were three times more likely to engage in oral sex and intercourse two years after exposure than non-exposed boys. Young girls exposed to sexual content in the media were twice as likely to engage in oral sex and one and a half times more likely to have intercourse. Research also shows that teens who listened to music with degrading sexual references were more likely to have sex than those who had less exposure.Why are teens more likely to have sex after being exposed to sexual content in the media? Just as we read specific books and show educational movies to our children in hopes that they learn lessons from the characters, the media provides a type of sex education to young people. Media messages normalize early sexual experimentation and portray sex as casual, unprotected and consequence-free, encouraging sexual activity long before children are emotionally, socially or intellectually ready.High-Risk Sex. The earlier a child is exposed to sexual content and begins having sex, the likelier they are to engage in high-risk sex. Research shows that children who have sex by age 13 are more likely to have multiple sexual partners, engage in frequent intercourse, have unprotected sex and use drugs or alcohol before sex. In a study by researcher Dr. Jennings Bryant, more than 66 percent of boys and 40 percent of girls reported wanting to try some of the sexual behaviors they saw in the media (and by high school, many had done so), which increases the risk of sexually transmitted diseases and unwanted pregnancies.Sex, Love and Relationship Addictions. Not every child who is exposed to sexual content will struggle with a mental health disorder, but research shows that early exposure to pornography is a risk factor for sex addictions and other intimacy disorders. In one study of 932 sex addicts, 90 percent of men and 77 percent of women reported that pornography was a factor in their addiction. With the widespread availability of explicit material on the Internet, these problems are becoming more prevalent and are surfacing at younger ages.Sexual Violence. According to some studies, early exposure (by age 14) to pornography and other explicit material may increase the risk of a child becoming a victim of sexual violence or acting out sexually against another child. For some people, habitual use of pornography may prompt a desire for more violent or deviant material, including depictions of rape, torture or humiliation. If people seek to act out what they see, they may be more likely to commit sexual assault, rape or child molestation.        Have you not had an epic enough fail on your topic?  This will be my last post on the matter.                              Good luck explaining away the experts with your vast knowledge of the sexuality of a 14 year old girl.  I'm sorry, a 14.5 year old girl.  Or boy.Still waiting on a rebuttal here.\n",

While the authors do not approve of the use of real children in the production or distribution of child pornography, they say that artificially produced materials might serve a purpose.Rebuttal 1 - Explaining the lack of a casual link as suggested by the above study:\"The inference to be drawn from this research is that legalizing and further increasing child pornography’s availability would decrease the incidence of child abuse.  The problem with these studies, and from which this one does not seem to be immune, is that there is no control for alternate or outside variables.  This research shows a correlation between availability of child porn – despite its illegality in most nations – and the decrease in child abuse, but ignores other explanations and ultimately cannot establish a causal relationship.This leads the critical reader to a disturbing place: What content competes with child pornography?  For one, there’s the entire genre of “barely legal” porn – just do a search for “teen” and the market’s representation is readily apparent.  We don’t care or pass judgment on any kind of porn, so long as its made by consenting adults, but it seems far-fetched to think that its producers aren’t at least cognizant of the child porn market when they specialize in cheerleader themes, models in braces, and pigtails.  To their credit, they are providing a legal alternative and monetizing a market segment that can otherwise ruin lives if handled irresponsibly.There is also the existence of virtual child pornography.  In 2002, the Free Speech Coalition won a decisive victory for expression over the DOJ in Free Speech Coalition v. Ashcroft, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. §§ 2256(8)(B) and (D) were unconstitutionally overbroad, as their prohibitions on virtual child pornography and production or distribution of material pandered as child pornography – even if it is not – captured speech that was not unprotected within the scope of its earlier decisions in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (defining the test for obscenity) or New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (allowing states to ban child pornography sales, as it was not protected speech).  While undoubtedly a small market – and one I have no interest in personally investigating – this allowance for computer-generated images and other “virtual” child pornography displaces the demand for actual child pornography, yet may contribute to the overall decline in child abuse crimes.Other possible reasons for the decreased incidence of child abuse despite increased child pornography availability may be more related to features of criminal law rather than the adult marketplace or First Amendment doctrines.  First, state and federal laws may have become stricter against child offenses, inhibiting child abuse despite the availability of child pornography.  20 years ago, implementing a ubiquitous data repository for every sex offender to be mapped out like many states have done under their respective Megan’s Law provisions, as the internet was not available.  But today, those databases are active and seemingly everywhere, ruining lives while providing dubious benefits to public safety.  Depending on the relevant state’s laws, viewing child pornography may carry a lesser prison sentence than actually touching a child, and be the economically efficient choice on that basis.  Because fulfilling one’s desire is going to result in penalties and sex offender registration either way, a rational pedophile is going to choose the path that costs him the least amount of his life behind bars.  Furthermore, downloading child porn is more likely to put him into a federal prison upon conviction or reaching a plea deal – a depressing place, but far preferable to many state prisons.  Another reason for this perceived decline in child abuse is simply that reporting it has gone down.  With families more broken than ever in recent history, do parents care, and do their children even tell them if they were molested?Ignoring these covariants and assuming the relationship between child porn availability and child abuse is causative, everyone from social scientists and policy-makers to parents is left with significant moral questions: Is it preferable to end child pornography so that the actors are not abused if it comes at the expense of the broader child population?  Or is it preferable that the actors suffer so fewer random children are victimized?  Ultimately this is a moral and ethical question that could be resolved with further research, but cannot be conclusively “answered” with any empirical truth.  Ultimately, society does not tolerate child abuse.  While the age of consent is an arbitrary line, the asymmetries of power and knowledge between adults and minors, wherever the line is drawn, makes preying on the young, the weak, the naive and inexperienced, so abhorrent.\"More fud from kmfkewm:QuoteWhen you made the viewing of CP illegal, you sharply increased the rate of actual child sex abuse.Rebuttal - A study that contradicts the Czech study, and the above quote:\"A longitudinal study of 341 convicted child molesters in America found that pornography's use correlated significantly with their rate of sexually re-offending. Frequency of pornography use was primarily a further risk factor for higher-risk offenders, when compared with lower-risk offenders, and use of highly deviant pornography correlated with increased recidivism risk for all groups.  The majority of men who have been charged with or convicted of child pornography offenses show pedophilic profiles on phallometric testing.  A study with a sample of 201 adult male child pornography offenders using police databases examined charges or convictions after the index child pornography offense(s). 56% of the sample had a prior criminal record, 24% had prior contact sexual offenses, and 15% had prior child pornography offenses. One-third were concurrently charged with other crimes at the time they were charged for child pornography offenses. 17% of the sample offended again in some way during this time, and 4% committed a new contact sexual offense. Child pornography offenders with prior criminal records were significantly more likely to offend again in any way during the follow-up period. Child pornography offenders who had committed a prior or concurrent contact sexual offense were the most likely to offend again, either generally or sexually.\"Really absent-minded FUD by kwmkewm:QuoteGo read the fucking tanner scale you retard.

A National Incidence Study of Child Abuse and Neglect issued by the Department of Health and Human Services found that both physical and sexual abuse of children have dropped significantly over the past 20 years: From 2005 to 2006, an estimated 553,000 children suffered physical, sexual or emotional abuse, down 26 percent from the estimated 743,200 abuse victims in 1993.

      "Quote from: kmfkewm on August 10, 2013, 10:16 amQuote from: Hungry ghost on August 10, 2013, 09:48 amSo, abusing children is wrong, but looking at pictures of people abusing children isn't? But how can you have one without the other? How can you have banks without bank robbery? How can you have humans without murder? Should we ban banks to get rid of bank robbery? Should we ban humans to get rid of murder? Saying we must ban looking at child pornography to get rid of producing child pornography is as absurd as saying these other things.QuoteHow can you engage in your harmless picture viewing without a child being abused?You cannot engage in harmless picture viewing without a child being abused (ignoring jailbait and nudist stuff). But there is something called an arrow of time. It moves forward. Children have already been abused in the past. Not looking at the pictures of the abuse makes them no less abused. The thing to look at here is cause and effect. You can engage in picture viewing without causing a child to be abused. QuoteThis personal freedom you are trying to defend only makes sense if you refuse to think about the whole chain of events. Yes, by viewing the picture you are not directly causing abuse, but its iimpossible for you to view the picture without that abuse taking place. (leaving aside drawings or convincing child robots)So what it is impossible for somebody to look at a picture without the abuse depicted in the picture having taken place? The abuse already took place! Not looking at the picture doesn't make it go away. I am thinking about the whole chain of events, I think you might not be thinking about the order of events. QuoteYou keep gloating about the logical fallacies others are committing in this thread, in the grip of the strong emotions child abuse engenders. But you are flinging them out left right and centre. In particular, the argument you keep falling back on seems very much a false analogy:      Child abuse is wrong >>>>so viewing pictures of it is wrong             Robbing banks is wrong>>>>so viewing pictures of robbery is wrong       The Holocaust is wrong>>>>so viewing pictures of it is wrong.      (Reducing to absurdity, showing the premise of an argument leads to absurd conclusions)       The key difference here is that people aren't robbing banks with the aim of making videos to share with fellow bank robbers, and egging each other on. The Holocaust wasn't committed with the aim of sharing the footage with other totalitarian states \"hey Stalin check this out LOL\"It is an irrelevant difference. All are victim creating crimes and all are pictures of crimes with victims depicted. The analogy is solid. Quote You are also muddying the water somewhat with talk of 14 year old ages of consent, and sexually mature teenagers. This is a completely seperate issue from paedophilia. Throughout most of history a girl was considered a woman when she reached sexual maturity (ie began menstruating). However for legal purposes we find it necessary to draw a line, in most states either 14 or 16. In most cases courts will deal much more leniently with a 17 year old who has had sex with a 14 year old, than a 30 year old who did the same. This seems fair enough to me.Seems more fair to me to lower the age of consent to something more reasonable. Some countries already have! A lot of them are even first world and highly populated :D. QuoteI agree that there is a huge amount of media and societal hysteria about paedophilia, (watch Chris Morris's Brasseye episode about \"paedogeddon\" for a funny take on this). I get that not all people that view CP are child murderering monsters, or even child molesters.Hell, even most of the inflated bullshit statistics from the crusaders agree that the majority of people viewing child porn are not child molesters and are not risks to children. Quote     The study you cite (\"dozens\" showing no correlation between legalising porn and increased sex crime, ONE showing the same for CP, the Czech one) seems kind of weak. Statistics from 1945-1989, then after 1989? Did any other major changes take place in Czech society between these two periods, that might affect a) the data and b) how the data was collected? On the internet, its fairly easy to find research that backs any position you care to take.  I don't think its clear whether the availability of CP effects the incidence of child abuse either way. I really don't think you can claim the evidence on your side, as you have done, several times in this thread, saying things along the lines of 'if you support restriction of CP you are actually increasing child abuse'. It is not a single one showing the link with CP and reduced sex abuse of minors, also Japan and many other countries as well. Sure can find citations for either argument, I can also find instances where the people arguing the other way have fabricated data and published fraudulent documents so I know who to trust.      QuoteYou keep hitting the same argument, looking at a picture of as crime is not the same as committing it. Sure, but when producing the pictures of the crime is a major motivation for the crime, the viewer is complicit. Although in a significant number of cases I imagine that producing pictures of the crime is a major motiviation (for example all of the commercial CP), I think that in a significant number of the cases producing a picture of the crime is a secondary motivation. Most people do not molest children just so they can take pictures of it, they molest children because they want to molest children and they take pictures of it because they can. And in any case, it is irrelevant. QuoteIf you watch it, you are complicit in its production. that makes as much sense as saying if I look at pictures of the holocaust I am complicit in genocide. If somebody looks at a picture of a child being abused so fucking what they had nothing to do with it, probably didn't pay for it, probably nobody even knows they did it. how the fuck is that complicit in the production of it? Quote Complicit: Associated with or participating in a questionable act or a crime So if it is the watching of the crime that makes someone complicit, then my argument about the holocaust stands. If you say that somebody participates in the crime by looking at pictures of it, then you are probably insane. QuoteYes, yes I know \"huh? So if I watch a film of a bank robbery I'm complicit in that too am I?\". No. These are two different situations as outlined above. The demand for the CP encourages the supply. This demand need not be monetary. I already have given citations that there is no evidence for this, but I know you think citations to things on the internet are useless. Okay I have a proposal then. There is a technology called private information retrieval. It lets somebody get an item from a set of databases without the set of databases being able to tell the item they got out of it. If we have a bunch of databases containing CP and various other items, and people use PIR to get items out of the database, then nobody can determine the demand for any of the individual items in the database. This effectively completely hides the demand for any of the individual items in the database. Do you think that if CP is only legal to view if it is obtained from a PIR system that it is okay? Because that handles the demand problem perfectly, nobody will know the demand for child pornography and you cannot use it as your reason to argue against it if it is only distributed via PIR. QuoteSo, non exclusive ephebephile? You like dem young girls? But you'll take a grown up lady if that's all that's going? Well I guess we can all understand that. But, where do we draw the line? In our society we regard girls under 16, although their bodies (their nubile soft young bodies.....) might be physically mature, as too young to give meaningful consent, and so they fall under the protection of the law, against exploitation. Obviously, on her 16 th  birthday, a girl doesn't suddenly change from a child into a woman, but we need these legal fictions for practical reasons.Well I am pretty clearly attracted to girls at age 14, really I could probably even go somewhat lower than that on a case by case basis. I have no interest at all in anybody who is not at all sexually developed, so I do not qualify as being a pedophile. I am interested in females between tanner stage 4 and 5 I would say, which can range from 13 to indefinite age (some females never even get to stage 5). I don't feel such strong compulsion to have sex with any particular age group that I would bother trying to do anything illegal like sleeping with underage teenagers (not going to find me on to catch a predator, lol), and I still wonder at what age it is okay to have sex with somebody without causing them harm. I really doubt that age is 16 or 18 personally. QuoteAh fuck it....I'm just going to call you a nonce like everyone else. NONCE!Damn you did such a good job being pretty rational and not foaming at the mouth and having decent arguments and not sounding like a fucking retard, don't throw it away now ;) !Hmmm....the whole 'but the abuse has already taken place, my viewing the pictures has no influence on it' is true, but very disingenuous. Its analogous to a vegatarian who believes that meat is murder but still eats meat because 'after all the animal is already dead, me eating the meat isn't killing any animals'       The PIR thought experiment is rather odd.

      "Quote from: Hungry ghost on August 10, 2013, 07:48 pmQuote from: kmfkewm on August 10, 2013, 10:16 amQuote from: Hungry ghost on August 10, 2013, 09:48 amSo, abusing children is wrong, but looking at pictures of people abusing children isn't? But how can you have one without the other? How can you have banks without bank robbery? How can you have humans without murder? Should we ban banks to get rid of bank robbery? Should we ban humans to get rid of murder? Saying we must ban looking at child pornography to get rid of producing child pornography is as absurd as saying these other things.QuoteHow can you engage in your harmless picture viewing without a child being abused?You cannot engage in harmless picture viewing without a child being abused (ignoring jailbait and nudist stuff). But there is something called an arrow of time. It moves forward. Children have already been abused in the past. Not looking at the pictures of the abuse makes them no less abused. The thing to look at here is cause and effect. You can engage in picture viewing without causing a child to be abused. QuoteThis personal freedom you are trying to defend only makes sense if you refuse to think about the whole chain of events. Yes, by viewing the picture you are not directly causing abuse, but its iimpossible for you to view the picture without that abuse taking place. (leaving aside drawings or convincing child robots)So what it is impossible for somebody to look at a picture without the abuse depicted in the picture having taken place? The abuse already took place! Not looking at the picture doesn't make it go away. I am thinking about the whole chain of events, I think you might not be thinking about the order of events. QuoteYou keep gloating about the logical fallacies others are committing in this thread, in the grip of the strong emotions child abuse engenders. But you are flinging them out left right and centre. In particular, the argument you keep falling back on seems very much a false analogy:      Child abuse is wrong >>>>so viewing pictures of it is wrong             Robbing banks is wrong>>>>so viewing pictures of robbery is wrong       The Holocaust is wrong>>>>so viewing pictures of it is wrong.      (Reducing to absurdity, showing the premise of an argument leads to absurd conclusions)       The key difference here is that people aren't robbing banks with the aim of making videos to share with fellow bank robbers, and egging each other on. The Holocaust wasn't committed with the aim of sharing the footage with other totalitarian states \"hey Stalin check this out LOL\"It is an irrelevant difference. All are victim creating crimes and all are pictures of crimes with victims depicted. The analogy is solid. Quote You are also muddying the water somewhat with talk of 14 year old ages of consent, and sexually mature teenagers. This is a completely seperate issue from paedophilia. Throughout most of history a girl was considered a woman when she reached sexual maturity (ie began menstruating). However for legal purposes we find it necessary to draw a line, in most states either 14 or 16. In most cases courts will deal much more leniently with a 17 year old who has had sex with a 14 year old, than a 30 year old who did the same. This seems fair enough to me.Seems more fair to me to lower the age of consent to something more reasonable. Some countries already have! A lot of them are even first world and highly populated :D. QuoteI agree that there is a huge amount of media and societal hysteria about paedophilia, (watch Chris Morris's Brasseye episode about \"paedogeddon\" for a funny take on this). I get that not all people that view CP are child murderering monsters, or even child molesters.Hell, even most of the inflated bullshit statistics from the crusaders agree that the majority of people viewing child porn are not child molesters and are not risks to children. Quote     The study you cite (\"dozens\" showing no correlation between legalising porn and increased sex crime, ONE showing the same for CP, the Czech one) seems kind of weak. Statistics from 1945-1989, then after 1989? Did any other major changes take place in Czech society between these two periods, that might affect a) the data and b) how the data was collected? On the internet, its fairly easy to find research that backs any position you care to take.  I don't think its clear whether the availability of CP effects the incidence of child abuse either way. I really don't think you can claim the evidence on your side, as you have done, several times in this thread, saying things along the lines of 'if you support restriction of CP you are actually increasing child abuse'. It is not a single one showing the link with CP and reduced sex abuse of minors, also Japan and many other countries as well. Sure can find citations for either argument, I can also find instances where the people arguing the other way have fabricated data and published fraudulent documents so I know who to trust.      QuoteYou keep hitting the same argument, looking at a picture of as crime is not the same as committing it. Sure, but when producing the pictures of the crime is a major motivation for the crime, the viewer is complicit. Although in a significant number of cases I imagine that producing pictures of the crime is a major motiviation (for example all of the commercial CP), I think that in a significant number of the cases producing a picture of the crime is a secondary motivation. Most people do not molest children just so they can take pictures of it, they molest children because they want to molest children and they take pictures of it because they can. And in any case, it is irrelevant. QuoteIf you watch it, you are complicit in its production. that makes as much sense as saying if I look at pictures of the holocaust I am complicit in genocide. If somebody looks at a picture of a child being abused so fucking what they had nothing to do with it, probably didn't pay for it, probably nobody even knows they did it. how the fuck is that complicit in the production of it? Quote Complicit: Associated with or participating in a questionable act or a crime So if it is the watching of the crime that makes someone complicit, then my argument about the holocaust stands. If you say that somebody participates in the crime by looking at pictures of it, then you are probably insane. QuoteYes, yes I know \"huh? So if I watch a film of a bank robbery I'm complicit in that too am I?\". No. These are two different situations as outlined above. The demand for the CP encourages the supply. This demand need not be monetary. I already have given citations that there is no evidence for this, but I know you think citations to things on the internet are useless. Okay I have a proposal then. There is a technology called private information retrieval. It lets somebody get an item from a set of databases without the set of databases being able to tell the item they got out of it. If we have a bunch of databases containing CP and various other items, and people use PIR to get items out of the database, then nobody can determine the demand for any of the individual items in the database. This effectively completely hides the demand for any of the individual items in the database. Do you think that if CP is only legal to view if it is obtained from a PIR system that it is okay? Because that handles the demand problem perfectly, nobody will know the demand for child pornography and you cannot use it as your reason to argue against it if it is only distributed via PIR. QuoteSo, non exclusive ephebephile? You like dem young girls? But you'll take a grown up lady if that's all that's going? Well I guess we can all understand that. But, where do we draw the line? In our society we regard girls under 16, although their bodies (their nubile soft young bodies.....) might be physically mature, as too young to give meaningful consent, and so they fall under the protection of the law, against exploitation. Obviously, on her 16 th  birthday, a girl doesn't suddenly change from a child into a woman, but we need these legal fictions for practical reasons.Well I am pretty clearly attracted to girls at age 14, really I could probably even go somewhat lower than that on a case by case basis. I have no interest at all in anybody who is not at all sexually developed, so I do not qualify as being a pedophile. I am interested in females between tanner stage 4 and 5 I would say, which can range from 13 to indefinite age (some females never even get to stage 5). I don't feel such strong compulsion to have sex with any particular age group that I would bother trying to do anything illegal like sleeping with underage teenagers (not going to find me on to catch a predator, lol), and I still wonder at what age it is okay to have sex with somebody without causing them harm. I really doubt that age is 16 or 18 personally. QuoteAh fuck it....I'm just going to call you a nonce like everyone else. NONCE!Damn you did such a good job being pretty rational and not foaming at the mouth and having decent arguments and not sounding like a fucking retard, don't throw it away now ;) !Hmmm....the whole 'but the abuse has already taken place, my viewing the pictures has no influence on it' is true, but very disingenuous. Its analogous to a vegatarian who believes that meat is murder but still eats meat because 'after all the animal is already dead, me eating the meat isn't killing any animals'       The PIR thought experiment is rather odd.

      "\t\t\t\tWell damn I typed out a long response to this but then I lost it. First of all I want to say that after this thread was locked I deleted it because I figured that there is no point to debate with people who think emotionally rather than logically. I knew that DPR didn't care about this thread, due to the fact that he commented in previous CP debate threads in the past. However, now that the thread is back, I think I will leave it anyway, simply because people keep going off topic in other threads and derailing them, and I don't want to see Astor's head explode :). I would also like to apologize for calling names a bit in this thread, usually I keep a much cooler head when debating this issue, but in this particular instance I got quite pissed off trying to argue with someone who in my perception was kind of just trolling me. QuoteHmmm....the whole 'but the abuse has already taken place, my viewing the pictures has no influence on it' is true, but very disingenuous. Its analogous to a vegatarian who believes that meat is murder but still eats meat because 'after all the animal is already dead, me eating the meat isn't killing any animals'When a person pays for meat and then consumes it, they are supporting the meat industry. If nobody paid for meat and nobody ate it, then nobody would kill animals. There is a causative relationship here, people pay for and eat meat and this causes people to kill animals. This is why the vegetarian is using flawed logic, if their goal is to stop the killing of animals. The more meat that is paid for and consumed, the more animals will be killed to meet demand. On the other hand, viewing child porn, isolated from all other variables, does not have a clear causative relationship with the production of child porn, and for this reason the analogy does not hold.   QuoteThe PIR thought experiment is rather odd. So, people upload CP to the server but have no way of knowing how many people are watching it? (If any)Therefore the people watching it are freed of any guilt because their views are anonymised from the providers? But people are still uploading CP for people to watch, and people are still watching it.  The demand is still there, and the child abusers are still filling it.If your argument is that viewing child porn creates demand and then this demand is filled by children being molested, the PIR argument makes perfect sense. Although I disagree with the demand/supply argument when it comes to child porn viewing / production, if I did believe it was real I would focus on ways to make it impossible for the demand to be known. Even if child porn consumption is illegal people are going to download and view it anyway, so if the danger of people downloading and viewing child porn is that it creates demand, I would think that a solution that hides the demand is better than a solution that criminalizes the people who create the demand. There are several technical solutions that can perfectly mask the demand for child pornography, while still allowing people to view it. One of the solutions would be Encrypted Keyword Search / Private Stream Searching. In these sorts of systems, a server exists that holds various items and associated keywords. If a child molester creates child pornography and uploads it to such a server, it would first be encrypted and tagged with various keywords that describe it. At this point it would be uploaded to the server, which would be oblivious to its content. Somebody who is interested in viewing child pornography would be able to query the server with a list of keywords of interest, the server would then be able to search for items that match those keywords and return them to the searcher, without being aware of any of the keywords searched for or any of the documents returned. Many people would use the same Encrypted Keyword Search server for various other activities, similar to how Tor is used for various activities with child pornography being only one of them. If the child pornography viewer keeps their CP related activities confined to the Encrypted Keyword Search system, nobody will be able to determine there demand for child pornography. The server will know they searched for something, but it wont know what they searched for and it will not know what they obtained. Likewise, the person who produced and uploaded the pornography (illegally, I am not saying this person is not a vile criminal by any means), will be totally incapable of determining that somebody downloaded the item that they uploaded. Therefor, the demand is perfectly hidden from anybody, and it seems that therefor if demand for child pornography is the reason for its production, that such a system would allow people to view child pornography without creating identifiable demand and therefor without contributing to the supply of child molestation. It is not the same thing as anonymity, it goes a step beyond it. Anonymity would mean that the server knows it hosts child pornography, and it knows somebody has downloaded child pornography, but it does not know who downloaded child pornography. This would mean that the demand for child pornography could still be identified, just not where the demand came from. With a private information retrieval based solution, the server would not know that *anybody* searched for or obtained child pornography. This means that not only is the user who downloaded the child pornography anonymous in doing so, but they create no trace of what they searched for or obtained in the first place. Clearly solutions similar to this can make the demand for child pornography unknown to anybody, while still allowing people to download and view child pornography. If the reason that downloading and viewing child pornography is bad is because it creates a demand for child pornography that is filled via the molestation of children, then it seems like this a great solution to that problem. When you say demand I take it to mean \"an identifiable request for child pornography\". When somebody downloads child pornography from a P2P network, there is an identifiable request for child pornography in that the peer they download it from can tell that somebody downloaded child pornography from them. The same is true in the case of child pornography hosted on a server and accessed through the clearnet, and in the case of child pornography hosted on a server and accessed via Tor or I2P, and indeed even in the case of child pornography hosted distributed throughout Freenet. None of these solutions mask the demand for child pornography, they only mask who is demanding it. On the other hand, Encrypted Keyword Search solutions can mask the demand for child pornography and therefor also mask who is demanding it. If by demand you simply mean \"A desire for child pornography\", then I have to assume that you wish for the death of most pedophiles, as most pedophiles have a desire for child pornography even if they do not act on that desire. Do you really wish to kill even the pedophiles who do not act on their desire to look at child pornography, simply so you can reduce the amount of desire for child pornography in the world? That seems incredibly cruel and unfair to me, pedophiles do not get to decide if they are pedophiles or not any more than homosexuals get to decide if they are homosexuals or not. A great many pedophiles would do anything possible to stop having sexual desires for children and therefor child pornography, and several of them do not even act on their desire for child pornography (although I have to imagine that looking at child pornography is prevalent in the pedophile community, as I imagine most straight men attracted to legal age people would continue looking at pornography even if it was outlawed to do so, and I think we see proof of this in the countries that have outlawed all forms of pornography). That said, I still find the idea that somebody will see a few hits on a servers log files and run out and molest some children because of it. To me that idea seems preposterous indeed, but to many people it seems obvious so whatever.QuoteI'm just not buying the idea that most CP is produced by people who were abusing children anyhow, and just decided to film it because they could, and therefore your viewing it is a harmless act. Its like saying most adult porn is just people who were having sex, and decided to film it because they could. Certainly in the past there have been instances of children who had naked photographs taken of them simply so somebody could sell the photographs and make a profit. There have been three big Eastern European studios, one of them paid about 1,500 girls ages about 8-17 to allow them to photograph them nude or semi-nude, for the production of softcore pornography. This studio took hundreds of photographs of each of the girls (all of which agreed to the shoots and had consent from parents as well, not that this justifies anything, I am just pointing out that they were not violently raped and then killed, as the person I was arguing with seems to think that nearly all CP involves brutal rape and snuff). The studio then sold them on the internet to make money. So indeed, if it was not for people buying child pornography on the internet, this studio would never have taken so many photographs of so many underage girls. In fact, earlier in this thread I said that these studios were responsible for the majority of child pornography, now I need to back track a little bit from that statement because I don't actually have statistics on the matter, but I still am sure that at least a large percentage of child pornography on the internet, by number of photographs, originated at these studios. So yes, in these cases, thousands of children were photographed naked who would not have been photographed naked had it not been for the financial demand for child pornography on the internet.However, these studios operated with the intention of making a profit. People who paid for the photographs often put them on Usenet and similar, where they were then downloaded by people who did not pay for them. If it had not been for the people paying for the pornography, the production studios would not have continued to produce it. They did not give a flying fuck if people downloading it for free liked it or not, and in fact they were upset that there content was being pirated as it lost them sales. So in these cases we can see that the people paying for the child pornography were indeed fueling the demand that led to a supply of sexualized photographs of naked minors. We can therefor say that it should be illegal to pay for child pornography, and it goes without saying that it should be illegal to produce child pornography. On the other hand, the people who were downloading the child pornography for free to view it, had no effect at all on the production of the child pornography, and therefor it makes no sense to say that their demand for these images fueled the supply of them. There is simply no link between them viewing the child porn and the producers producing it, the only link in these cases was between the people paying for the child pornography and the people producing it.There are other cases where children are molested because of child pornography as well, and I would actually argue that many of these children would not be molested if it were legal to view AND distribute child pornography. These cases arise from the private underground trading communities. To gain membership to some of these groups you are required to submit original content, this is because they use it as a security mechanism to prevent the police from joining the group. They know that no police are going to abuse children on camera in order to infiltrate them, so they make new recruits abuse children on camera in order to gain membership. The other sort of group that leads to child molestation, and indeed the most worrying groups in modern times, are the forums like Dreamboard. These groups require members to upload new content every period of time in order to maintain there membership. The content that they upload cannot be content that is already part of the group collection. This puts pressure on pedophiles to molest children to produce original content, after the group invariably gets to the point that their collection is so large that individual members no longer have any new child pornography that the group does not have. When this time arises, the member is forced to either molest a child to maintain membership in the group, or to lose their group membership. This puts pressure on pedophiles who want to continue having access to child pornography but may not really want to actually molest a child. The reason many of these groups do this is because they want to keep law enforcement out as well. If the viewing AND distributing of child pornography was not illegal, these groups would have no reason to require members to continuously upload child pornography as a security mechanism, as they would not be breaking the law in the first place, and therefor would not need to keep the police out of their groups. Additionally, by making it so they can relax their security, the police would have an easier time gaining membership in their groups and identifying newly produced child pornography from an earlier point in time.These are the cases where I think children are molested because of child pornography. In almost all of the other cases, I think it is indeed essentially people who molest kids already and who decide to take pictures of it because they can. I would compare the studios in Eastern Europe to the adult commercial studios, the people in the private groups requiring uploads for membership I cannot think of what they are analogous to, and the other people are analogous to the people creating amateur homemade pornography and uploading it to the internet. Indeed, a huge amount of pornography on the internet consists of people who were having sex and filmed it because they could. QuoteI like taking certain drugs. Now, when I'm smoking weed or heroin, I did not literally cause the weed or heroin to be grown or imported ; that happened in the past and so my current behaviour cannot be said to cause it. Times arrow, as you say. But I have to take a pretty narrow and blinkered view of the chain of cause and effect to deny that my current drug use has no effect on the production of these drugs. Western demand (of which I form a tiny part) drives the production of these drugs. Certainly your drug use leads to the cultivation and production of these drugs. Beyond any doubt. Just as a person who eats meat leads to the slaughter of animals. People grow marijuana or poppies because they know they can turn them into financial reward for themselves, because they know you will pay money for the end product. There is an easy to determine causative relationship between you eating meat and animals being slaughtered, there is an easy to determine causative relationship between you smoking weed and marijuana being grown. There is no such easy to determine causative relationship between a person viewing child pornography, isolated from finances and group membership requirements, and a person molesting a child. The reason why a causative relationship is easy to establish in the cases of meat and marijuana is because something of value goes from you to the producer, and that something of value is the end goal of the producer. This is why it should obviously be illegal to pay for child pornography, and indeed there is a causative relationship between people paying for child pornography and the production of child pornography in the Eastern European studios. However, again, there is not a causative relationship between the people downloading the child pornography made is Eastern European studios off of P2P networks, and the production of child pornography by the Eastern European studios. Indeed, if nobody paid for the child pornography created by the Eastern European studios, and everybody downloaded it off of peer to peer networks, they wouldn't continue to make it. The causative link between people viewing those images, isolated from finances, and the production of those images, simply does not exist. Quote        You are getting confused with your rhetoric here.

      "QuoteIncorrect information given by kmfkewm:Quote        I said that full sexual maturity, a developmental stage in biological development, is reached on average, at age 14.5 in females. I also said that peak fertility is reached at about the same age, and then starts to decline sometime in the 20s.http://www.patient.co.uk/doctor/Puberty-Normal-and-Abnormal.htmfemales: adult pubic hair average age 14.6, adult breasts average age 14.5, so my bad it is 14.6 when they reach full adult sexual maturity. As for peak fertility, I cannot easily find studies that start below the age of 22, however the claim that females reach their peak fertility between the ages of 23 and 31 is clearly false re: http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/blog/inpractice/age.jpeg which shows a sharp decline starting at age 24. What the study you quoted meant by \"females reach their peak fertility between 23 and 31\" is that females fertility rapidly declines starting at age 23 to 31, which is made clear by the graphs. I cannot find a citation for when females *begin* their peak fertility, but it is clearly not after the age of 22, and none of the studies I can find show information on teenagers right now. In the past I read that teenagers reach their highest degree of fertility a few years after the onset of puberty, I believe at about age 14.5, which is also when they on average reach their adult sexual level of physical development. So no, I am not wrong, you are wrong. QuoteRebuttal 1 - fertility; quote direct from a WebMD article aptly entitled Fertility-101:                 \"Most women hit their fertile peak between the ages of 23 and 31, though the rate at which women conceive begins to dip slightly in their late 20s. Around age 31, fertility starts to drop more quickly — by about 3 percent per year — until you hit 35 or so.\"http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/health/blog/inpractice/2011/11/pregnancy_now_or_later_1.htmlsee the problem is that all of these studies start at around age 22, but regardless you are clearly misinterpreting their strange use of the word \"hit their peak\", which actually means that they begin their decline. You can clearly see this on the graphs that I linked to, where after age 23 a sharp decline in fertility takes place, with fertility between age 22 through the end of 23 being stable. The resolution of these studies is not high enough to compare the fertility of a 14.5 year old to a 22 year old, although I am pretty certain they will be the same (and less prior to 14.5, which is why I would say a female hits her peak fertility at the age of 14.5, not hits her peak at the age 23, when it is obvious from looking at the graphs that the decline in fertility actually starts toward the end of 23 start of 24). QuoteRebuttal 2 - sexuality; quoted from a Cornell University(more accredited than the U of Hawaii) Study:       \"In men, testosterone levels reach their apex around age 18, while women’s estrogen (and fertility) hits a high-water mark during the mid- to late-20s. This hot-and-heavy stage of sexual maturity is known as the genital prime, because it’s when the body responds most quickly to arousal.\"This is in contrast to the chart I linked to (and I can find many other charts that look the same), where is shows a 22 year old is significantly more fertile than a female in her mid to late 20s. Here are more charts showing the same thing:http://assets.babycenter.com/i/infertilitygraph.gifhttp://qfg.com.au/about-fertility/female-reproductive-system/effect-of-age-womens-fertilityAnother point that has become apparent to me is that fertility unfortunately means two things, it means the probability of a female becoming pregnant and also the rate at which females become pregnant. A 30 year old is much less likely to become pregnant than a 22 year old, but when the term fertility is used in analysis of pregnancy rates, it is apparent that far more 30 year olds become pregnant than 22 year olds:http://www.ined.fr/en/everything_about_population/graph_month/age_fecondity/This introduces ambiguity to the term of fertility, as I am trying to find the age when a female is most likely to be most capable of becoming pregnant regardless of her desire to attempt to do so, not when a female is most likely to try to become pregnant regardless of her ability to do so. It is possible that the studies you have quoted with particularly outlandish numbers (late twenties to early thirties) for the first definition of fertility are actually discussing the second definition of fertility, and that would make sense as well. Quote    \"According to Dr. Marc Goldstein of Cornell University, hormones don't decide when you hit your sexual apex. People aren't soda bottles that just reach a point of maximum pressure and then pop. Your \"sexual peak\" has more to do with your attitude toward sex and level of experience, which is one reason millions of awkward young men spend their entire sexual prime on a computer(this means you KMF).\"That is not a technical definition of sexual peak and is thus irrelevant as far as I am concerned. QuoteRebuttal 1 - Explaining the lack of a casual link as suggested by the above study:\"The inference to be drawn from this research is that legalizing and further increasing child pornography’s availability would decrease the incidence of child abuse.  The problem with these studies, and from which this one does not seem to be immune, is that there is no control for alternate or outside variables.  This research shows a correlation between availability of child porn – despite its illegality in most nations – and the decrease in child abuse, but ignores other explanations and ultimately cannot establish a causal relationship.But the studies linking child porn to 1000% of child sex abuse on the other hand have controlled for all variables? The studies showing a fall in child abuse when child pornography viewing is legalized have taken place in several different countries in several different time frames, that will help control for many variables. QuoteThere is also the existence of virtual child pornography.  In 2002, the Free Speech Coalition won a decisive victory for expression over the DOJ in Free Speech Coalition v. Ashcroft, 535 U.S. 234 (2002).  In that case, the Supreme Court held that 18 U.S.C. §§ 2256(8)(B) and (D) were unconstitutionally overbroad, as their prohibitions on virtual child pornography and production or distribution of material pandered as child pornography – even if it is not – captured speech that was not unprotected within the scope of its earlier decisions in Miller v. California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973) (defining the test for obscenity) or New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982) (allowing states to ban child pornography sales, as it was not protected speech).  While undoubtedly a small market – and one I have no interest in personally investigating – this allowance for computer-generated images and other “virtual” child pornography displaces the demand for actual child pornography, yet may contribute to the overall decline in child abuse crimes.There was essentially no virtual child porn when the Czech study in particular was carried out.QuoteOther possible reasons for the decreased incidence of child abuse despite increased child pornography availability may be more related to features of criminal law rather than the adult marketplace or First Amendment doctrines.  First, state and federal laws may have become stricter against child offenses, inhibiting child abuse despite the availability of child pornography.  The US was not one of the countries studied as child porn is not legal to view there. I guess a good study in the US would be to look at child sex abuse rates before CP was made illegal, compare the child sex abuse rates after CP was made illegal and then compare that to child sex abuse rates when internet child pornography became extremely popular despite its illegality. My guess is we will find a spike in child abuse cases after child pornography was made illegal to view and a drop in child abuse cases correlating with the rise of the internets popularity and the amount of child pornography made available through the internet. Quote20 years ago, implementing a ubiquitous data repository for every sex offender to be mapped out like many states have done under their respective Megan’s Law provisions, as the internet was not available.  But today, those databases are active and seemingly everywhere, ruining lives while providing dubious benefits to public safety.  Depending on the relevant state’s laws, viewing child pornography may carry a lesser prison sentence than actually touching a child, and be the economically efficient choice on that basis.  Because fulfilling one’s desire is going to result in penalties and sex offender registration either way, a rational pedophile is going to choose the path that costs him the least amount of his life behind bars.  Furthermore, downloading child porn is more likely to put him into a federal prison upon conviction or reaching a plea deal – a depressing place, but far preferable to many state prisons.  This seems like an argument for me to post so I have no comment.  QuoteIgnoring these covariants and assuming the relationship between child porn availability and child abuse is causative, everyone from social scientists and policy-makers to parents is left with significant moral questions: Is it preferable to end child pornography so that the actors are not abused if it comes at the expense of the broader child population?  Or is it preferable that the actors suffer so fewer random children are victimized?  Ultimately this is a moral and ethical question that could be resolved with further research, but cannot be conclusively “answered” with any empirical truth.  Ultimately, society does not tolerate child abuse.  While the age of consent is an arbitrary line, the asymmetries of power and knowledge between adults and minors, wherever the line is drawn, makes preying on the young, the weak, the naive and inexperienced, so abhorrent.\"\"Is it better that we cause more children to become molested, or better if we prevent more children from becoming molested while allowing pedophiles to look at images of children who were already molested in the past, and are never going to get less molested in the future\". \n",

      "Quote from: Croskin on August 17, 2013, 02:48 pmAre we really arguing about CP... How about OP goes and visits all of the CP sites on Tor and then makes a statement that CP isn't harmful. Well, legally I am forbidden from going to CP sites on Tor to come to any conclusion about CP. I suppose I could trust the same people who have lied to me about drugs, but I give them no credit. It is illegal to have an opinion on CP based on the evidence, that is part of the issue. And to the best of my understanding, there are many \"CP\" sites that only have self taken photographs of teenagers doing such disgusting vile things as flashing their mirrors. Of course I understand when it is discussed in the media all CP consists of the violent rape and torture of innocent prepuberty children, but from what I can legally determine that is a minor part of CP, and the spectrum pretty much ranges from the incredibly popular underage teenager sites through to prepuberty children posing partially nude or at nudist beaches, all the way to young children being molested and at the most extreme and rarest end young children being raped and tortured. And my opinion is that viewing any picture is no worse than viewing any other picture, so I do not hold those viewing rape to any different standard than I hold those viewing naked teenagers. Certainly I think the pedophiles are actually mentally ill, and the sadists of course are mentally ill as well, but I do not judge people based on their mental illnesses I judge them based on their actions. Viewing images is not an action that leads to harm upon others. QuoteYes, I understand that he is arguing about having images/videos.  The fact is that CP will never be legal and will be criminalized in even more parts of the world because of the innocence of children. In the past people said black people will never be free because of the superiority of white people. You cannot see into the future, but I see the trend is that over time people come to understand things they used to fear and freedom tends to increase rather than decrease. Viewing CP is very likely to be legalized in the majority of the world eventually, too many things are in favor of this happening and only irrationality is against it. CP is already legal to view in half of the world, the main pressure against this is the USA but the power of the USA to influence other countries will continue to fall. QuoteEven if you are just looking at \"mild\" photos, that isn't what constitutes as all of CP.  over 70% of CP is a child being raped, held against their will (or better knowing), being manipulated into doing something, or having a photo taken of them without knowing what it actually is.Citation neededQuoteChildren don't have better judgement from experience in life, CP exploits that by telling children that \"everything is fine\" or that\"everyone does this and it is okay/normal\" because they don't know any better.  Any adult today that is of a sane mind, has just morales, and isn't a pedo would completely disagree with taking advantage of what we are supposed to be protecting and teaching.People keep trying to change the subject to production for some reason, I don't know why since I already said production is bad and of course must remain illegal, as it is in essentially the entire world (versus possession which is illegal only in half of the world, with many places where it is illegal only having small penalties associated with it. The USA is bar none the most rabid country when it comes to CP, with people facing regularly multi decade sentences and life time registration as sex offenders, where as in the majority of the world where CP is illegal to view people face only fines or warnings or a few years in jail). QuoteCP really fucks with childrens minds... Give me a case of CP where the child has grown up to be normal and to not disagree with what was done to them?  Take this thread for example: This actually projects the general opinion of most of the world on CP.  Everyone who puts any thought into it knows that it is wrong. And you continue to argue against production although that has never been what I have said should be legal. However, much CP is actually self produced by teenagers. QuoteWhen you say that CP will be illegal, there is a drop in the ocean chance that \"soft\" porn will even be considered in legalization.  Maybe 1 pedo official that is just jumping for juvies over the matter. As for the other 70% that a pedo rarely doesn't partake in, there is no chance whatsoever. In the future all information will be free, people will not continue to support censorship. \n",

      "QuotePeople like you JohnTheBaptist, who justify the rape and abuse of children because some people in an Eastern Block country have no money and can't pay a bill, have clearly been affected by long term drug abuse or perhaps were born retarded!Well, all the Eastern European studios are long since gone. He is wrong to say that CP production is a multi million dollar industry, in the past it was worth a small number of millions, but today there is essentially no financial component involved. People vastly over estimate the financial aspect of CP even in the past when it played an infinitely more significant role than it does today. That said, the children pictured in the softcore porn from Eastern Europe did all \"consent\" to be pictured and had the consent of their parents and largely of the community it was based out of. They apparently figured having food for the family was a higher priority than their daughters not posing semi nude for a production studio. That said I don't even try to justify the production of CP, it is another can of worms and not something I am interested in fighting for. I will say there are shades of gray with even that though, from the teenagers self producing to the softcore studios to the actual rape and abuse filmed by molesters. I will say that I find it completely arbitrary that the US has ruled the following image of Brooke Shields as art and not child porn: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturenews/6248757/Brooke-Shields-photographer-disappointed-by-police-pornography-claim.html (cropped photo, full thing is legal in US but possibly considered CP in UK and probably CP in other countries so not gonna post link to full picture but you can find it on google really easily if you look)http://www.artlyst.com/articles/police-censor-richard-prince-photograph-at-tate-modernQuoteThe work in the Pop Life exhibition,also titled Spiritual America was due to go on public show at Tate Modern today. It has now been voluntarily withdrawn after a warning from Scotland Yard that the nude image of heavily made up actor Brooke Shields, aged 10 could break obscenity laws. The pop artist Richard Prince reuses the image taken,by Gary Gross when Brooke was 10. Shields's mother authorised the shoot, and the photographs appeared in a Playboy Press book entitled \"Sugar and Spice\" (wow,where were they at in the 1970's???) In 1981 Shields launched  legal action aimed at preventing further use of the pictures. It was unsuccessful.but the softcore images from Eastern Europe of course are all child porn, when many of them are to the best of my knowledge essentially identical. In both cases the parents consent, the child consented at the time (although as we can see in the case of Brooke Shields, she later wished she had not, which makes sense since she was 10 at the time and a 10 year old pressured by her mother can not be seen as consenting in my eyes), and in both cases the family was paid. So it is essentially identical to much of the softcore Eastern European CP, so why is it the courts say people go to prison for that but in the case of Brooke Shields they say she cannot have it classified as CP or restrict people from looking at it? It is arbitrary bullshit and people are going to prison over shit like this in some cases and in other cases they get the blessing of the US government.    Quote  >:(  To suggest I'm not looking at things objectively when you have put forward this farcical claim that people won't have any money if CP is shut down in their country, is beyond comprehension. Well, I am sure people still have money in Ukraine now that all of the production studios have been shut down. The production studios generally claimed to be making art, much like the Brooke Shields photograph was claimed to be art and ruled as such by the US courts, and not to be making child porn, but later on in their careers I think they started taking even more suggestive photographs. In any case they were not taking photographs of rape and torture and snuff, and they do account for a huge percentage of CP produced so I really want to see the citations for these \"almost all\" and 70% statistics. Quote >:( You would have to be a pedo yourself or completely insane to allow children to suffer such horrific abuse.  >:(  You wouldn't have a clue about anything I have so shove your assumptions up your ass champ.  >:(  Your reasoning is absurd and completely irrational to anybody with a shred of intelligence.  >:( Only a twisted, idiotic, vile fool like yourself could put forward the preposterous notion that people can't eat or pay bills without their children being raped and abused during CP scenes, which are taped or photographed so sick bastards like you JohnTheBaptist, can get off!I don't think any of the Eastern European CP from the two major studios even had penetration. It was mostly semi nude and nude posing as far as I can tell, not going to actually go looking through it as that would be illegal and would result in me getting ass raped in prison for some reason. I think most of it wasn't much different from that infamous Brooke Shields photograph series. It probably also really did help with the bills for the poor people in the areas it was made in, but hey I agree that child abuse to pay the bills is no justification for child abuse. That is an even more libertarian argument that what I am putting forth (many libertarians are in favor of legalized child prostitution in cirumstances where the child can pick between starving to death and prostitution, I am not going to get into that can of worms right now). Quote You, like your best mate, will hopefully one day end up in prison, where you'll get what you deserve once the general population gets wind of why your there.  >:(  They love people like you in there.  :P You can tell them your justifications for looking at such sick, vile acts on poor, innocent children and I'm sure they'll lend you a shoulder to cry on. Next you'll probably claim that you don't even look at CP?? Go to hell!!  >:(Certainly I do not try to look at anything I would consider to depict children in pornographic situations, largely due to the fact that I don't find myself as being sexually attracted to children. \n",

That's incomprehensible and a completely fictitious statement.  ???I mean, you can verify this shit if you want to. Pedophilia is considered a proper diagnosis in any case where a person over 16 has sex with a minor 13 or under and I believe 4 years younger than the subject. In the 1850's the age of consent in Australia was 10. Quote1882    The age of consent for girls is raised from 10 to 14 years of age. and didn't get raised to the reasonable age of 14 until 1882. I have no idea the average age of wives in 1850's Australia , but I imagine 12 and 13 year old wives were not rare by any means. Here is a citation for 13 and 14 year old wives being common in 18th century Americahttp://www.iroquoisdemocracy.pdx.edu/html/colonialwoman.htmQuoteBoth men and women had great social pressure on them to marry. Young girls were often married by the age of 13 or 14.I can actually find many citations in any direction in regard to historic marriage of those 12-13, ranging from \"it happened rather uncommonly\" all the way to \"it happened all the damn time\". prior to the 16th century:QuoteMarriages were often arranged when the girls were only three of four years old. The law stated at the time that a girl as young as seven was capable of consenting to marriage. However, the marriage could not be consummated until the girl was 12 years old. In the 14th century courts were unwilling to convict rapists when the victim was pregnant. It was generally believed that her pregnancy signalled God's approval of the marriage. QuoteBefore modern history (16th century), child marriage was a common practice found everywhere in the world. With the advent of 20th century, the practice began to be questioned, discouraged by a majority but not all governments, and child marriage practice has been declining across the world.that is the best I am going to do for right now, it shows citation for marriage to 13 year olds (pedophilia today) being common in 18th century America, and child brides 12 and 13 as being a common practice found everywhere in the world prior to the 16th century. The age of consent laws didn't make what today can be diagonsed as pedophilia illegal in Australia until the very end of the 19th century, but I don't know how widespread it was practiced at that point in time. I can find several citations for relatively high average ages of marriage in the 19th and 18th century European countries, but with legal marriage to those 12 and older practiced uncommonly. I can also find some citations that go against this and claim that child brides were more common during these periods.So yeah the more modern you get the less widespread pedophilic practices were, with a sharp drop off in the 16th century but not totally extinguished and made illegal until the mid to late 19th century, with possible normality/popularity maintained into at least the mid 18th century according to some sources. \n",

      "Quote from: kmfkewm on August 21, 2013, 08:05 pmQuoteIf you agree, then stop letting kmfkewm direct the discussion. He has failed to justify the context in which he stands, and yet you're validating a discussion he wishes to have *within* that context. Refuse to engage until he justifies his starting position.What? I think I have justified my position quite well through out this entire thread. I have not got around to making a reply to your previous post yet, but I will do so right now. I spent most of yesterday trying to find how common child marriage was in 1850's Australia, and didn't have time to answer your post as well. I think my previous posts have at least proven than wadozo's claim that pedophilia has always been hated by the community is certainly completely incorrect, and given citations that pedophilia (by todays definition) was extremely common and socially acceptable everywhere up to the 16th century, and stretching into the 19th century, and still legal to practice in some places even today. This seems to mean that people engaging in pedophilic relationships WERE the community for almost all of human history, and that they have only been seen as evil in the past hundred and fifty years or so. Certainly today the rabidness against them is at an all time high. However this is a technicality, as I said, due to the fact that pedophilia includes attraction to those up to 13 years old. Essentially you can either admit that attraction to 12 and 13 year olds is not pedophilia, or you have to admit that pedophilia was widespread and socially accepted for most of human history. I have no problem taking your words and evidence so far that \"pedophilia was widespread and socially accepted for most of human history\". The same can be said of many horrific human behaviors including, off the top of my head: slavery, bear baiting, vivisection, circumcision (esp. female), genocide. Our historical views of these practices were clearly incorrect, and the same can be said of CP.QuoteQuoteWe can know that CP is wrong because it willfully imposes great suffering upon those who are not yet capable of understanding what is happening to them. CP is still being made, which means that people are still inflicting terrible suffering upon the innocent. Why do all of your arguments make it sound like I am saying it should be legal to produce CP? I never have claimed this.When arguing about a disturbing topic such as this, it is *your* responsibility to make clear the context in which you are operating. As I said above, it appears that you simply prefer being controversial over being clearly understood.Quote The problem I think is that your mind is incapable of seeing the trees in the forest but rather can only view the forest as a whole. This is characterized by your use of the phrase \"CP is wrong\". You see, I don't argue anything about the morality of CP, rather I break it down into \"CP viewing\", \"CP distribution\", \"CP production of softcore material\", \"CP production of hardcore material / rape\" , \"self produced CP\", \"Jailbait\", etc. This allows me to analyze the individual components of \"CP\" and come to independent conclusions on their morality, whereas you seem incapable of looking at things as the parts that make them up and rather are forced to look at things as a whole.The problem in my mind, hm? I'm fairly sure I granted you that \"CP viewing\" may indeed be a valid form of preventing pedophiles from acting on their desires. Let's see:Quote from: abitpeckishPerhaps if you had a proposal to effectively halt to all new CP production, you would see less vitriolic reactions to your positionI guess that's a pretty soft way of saying it. If it wasn't clear to you before, it should be now. But we're still left with the problem of CP *production* which, regardless of your attempts toward \"seeing the trees\", ignores that those trees currently exist in a putrid and very much thriving forest of suffering and despair. This must be solved or at least positively addressed before we can even begin to have the conversation you're attempting to have. If you don't see this you should really sit quietly for some time and contemplate why, because it is *clearly* true.QuoteQuotePedo/hebe/ephebo-philia in *thought* is clearly a manifestation of the human brain, and as such is difficult to quantify as categorically bad. However: excessive attachment to those thoughts, obsession with those thoughts, and *acting* on those thoughts are clearly manifestations of a *malfunctioning* human brain. The consensus of the mental health community is at odds with this statement. Hebephilia and ephebophilia are not considered mental illnesses despite a small fringe group of crusaders lobbying for this to be the case. Additionally, it is pretty well accepted that average males are non-exclusive ephebophiles, so your argument is essentially that males have malfunctioning brains.  Please read what I wrote and you quoted again, this time for comprehension. I never said hebe/ephebo-philia are mental illnesses. I said that acting excessively attaching, obsessing over, and acting on those kinds of thoughts are mainfestations of a malfunctioning brain. Ultimately it's the acting that's the real problem here, but the compulsions and obsessions obviously precipitate the actions.QuoteQuoteWe must all choose the thoughts/emotions/impulses we attach to whenever we can, and people that are dangerously malfunctioning in this regard can be rightly removed from greater society without any need for anger or retribution. Which is the same thing as saying they *should* be removed from greater society, without any need for anger or retribution.Your claim that hebephiles and ephebophiles have malfunctioning brains is contested by the mental health community, so the basis for your argument is largely on a notion pulled out of your own ass. See the immediately above, and do try to refrain from obsessing over my (admittedly beautiful) ass.QuoteQuoteWhat you are saying here is definitely true, but it is not really applicable to the child pornography argument. You are attempting to equate fundamentally different things.No they are fundamentally identical. I can't wait to read your supporting argument for this.QuoteQuotePictures of Jews being tortured and killed during the holocaust depict a historical event.Pictures made with cameras inherently depict historical events. Playing games with language isn't going to wrangle you out of this corner. You are intentionally misinterpreting my meaning here, but allow me to restate: \"Pictures of Jews being tortured and killed during the Holocaust depict a significant and recognizable historical period of human history in which millions of humans attempted to systematically and permanently strip an ethnicity of its dignity, livelihood, and erase it altogether.\"QuoteQuoteThey are propagated and shoved into the collective human consciousness as a reminder and warning about the nature of our more evil impulses when left unchecked. And you think that no CP is a visual depiction of the evil unchecked impulses of humans? And you believe that the intent behind most CP propagation is to teach each other a lesson about the dangers of human potential when compassion is not held as a high virtue?QuoteQuotePerhaps most importantly, there will never again be new pictures of Jews being tortured and killed during the holocaust. This is where your argument unravels. A child who turns 18 will never have pornography of them produced again that is illegal to view. On the other hand, there will still be war crimes carried out in the future, and the pictures of these crimes will still be legal to view. My argument certainly does not \"unravel\" here, you can merely replace the instance of the behavior \"the holocaust\" with the genus of the behavior \"war crimes\" and now your argument has fallen apart. You simply do not get to invoke historical documents of collective/species level atrocities (e.g. Holocaust, war crimes, etc) as being equivalent with those committed against preyed upon individuals (e.g. child pornography). This is veiled domain switching, and it undermines anything you attempt to build upon it before your argument ever leaves the gate. In short, you have failed to carve out a valid starting position upon which your arguments can stand. QuoteQuoteThere's no point playing the reduction game that followed this, because these are not comparable concepts. They are totally comparable concepts, sorry that I reduced your logic to absurdity. First of all, you did no such thing. If anything, you reduced your own to absurdity.Secondly, All human thought-in-language reduces to absurdity because communication needs context. You can have a perfectly logical argument that is also perfectly, logically wrong because the context in which it resides is faulty. Which is exactly what's happened here. Your arguments make a certain amount of sense, but the current reality in which you are arguing this is itself faulty and must be addressed.QuoteQuoteThe problem with CP in this context is that children continue to be harmed in the making of it. Children continue to be harmed by war crimes.... (the holocaust is an individual historical instance of a behavior)Yeah, and that continues to be wrong too.QuoteChildren depicted in pornography who have now turned 18 do not continue to be harmed by people making child porn... (the present time behavior of making CP does not continue to effect individuals who were affected by it in the past but who can no longer be depicted as the children victims of CP production)Here you go domain-switching again. You open by referring to a collection of individuals who have already been harmed by saying they are not being harmed by new CP production...COMPLETELY ignoring that there are a continuous flow of NEW individuals being harmed by CP production. You're a smart person, this much is clear. Your empathy, however, leaves much to be desired. This should bother you.Quoteso either I can argue that you are wrong because you place improper importance on the historic property of the instance of a behavior,If you've successfully made this argument, I have failed to see it. Please point it out to me.Quoteor I can run along with your argument and claim that it should be legal to view CP of children who have now turned 18, as they cannot continue to be harmed by the production of CP. How do you know that these people are not continuously harmed by the propagation of the CP in which they are involved? How do you know that the very fact that CP continues to be produced (i.e. children continue to be abused in this way) is not increasing the suffering of these victims? Where is your support for this claim?QuoteQuotePerhaps if you had a proposal to effectively halt to all new CP production, you would see less vitriolic reactions to your position. Until then, it is difficult for people to understand you speaking this way in any other context than the reality we all live in, where innocent children are having their lives ripped from them by those who clearly do/should know better. People who must be sought out, caught, and removed from society. It is *especially* difficult for people to think in this context (no more new CP) because you yourself have failed to propose/clarify it, and are apparently perfectly happy to be misunderstood as long as it gets you lulz.Sure there are some ways we can reduce the amount of new CP, probably nobody can completely halt it though.Which is why I said \"effectively\". I'm not naive enough to think we can stop it completely.QuoteI note that you are not against banning people from viewing photographs of the holocaust despite the fact that war crimes continue and are still being photographed today.Then you should also note that this is not in any way inconsistent, as I have elaborated above.QuoteOne way to reduce the amount of CP production is by legalizing the viewing of CP, since studies in every country that has legalized the viewing of CP show that this causes the rate of child sexual abuse to fall significantly. Also, you continue to switch back and forth between arguing against legalizing CP and then using reasoning that only argues against legalizing the production of CP.Again the problem is \"where does the CP come from?\". I'm all for destigmatizing hebe/ephebo-philia and possibly even pedophilia in THOUGHT form, and perhaps treatment of the impulses indeed should involve the viewing of CP while under the care of a licensed, scientifically credentialled professional who ultimately bears some responsibility for the actions of the patient. When thoughts become actions, however, that's where we have a problem and that's where your argument continues to fall flat.\n",

      "QuoteI have no problem taking your words and evidence so far that \"pedophilia was widespread and socially accepted for most of human history\". The same can be said of many horrific human behaviors including, off the top of my head: slavery, bear baiting, vivisection, circumcision (esp. female), genocide. Our historical views of these practices were clearly incorrect, and the same can be said of CP.Against Wadozo I never argued that the historic normality of pedophilia made it morally acceptable, I merely argued against his claim that it has been frowned upon throughout history. If he said that slavery has always been seen as immoral and I showed him citations that it was once very common, it would not mean I support slavery. I think 14 is a good enough age of consent and that is the age I have always argued for, that is not legalization of active pedophilia.QuoteWhen arguing about a disturbing topic such as this, it is *your* responsibility to make clear the context in which you are operating. As I said above, it appears that you simply prefer being controversial over being clearly understood.I have said multiple times in this thread that I am only arguing that it should not be illegal to look at CP, maybe you should try reading the thread some time so you can understand my position before trying to attack it. QuoteThe problem in my mind, hm? I'm fairly sure I granted you that \"CP viewing\" may indeed be a valid form of preventing pedophiles from acting on their desires. Let's see:Yes your mind clearly has problems with detail analysis and it is leading you to irrational behavior that causes great harm to many people when society gets behind it. If you think CP viewing is valid outlet for pedophiles and will lead to less molestation, why are you against making it legal? Because you want more children to be molested??QuoteQuote from: abitpeckishPerhaps if you had a proposal to effectively halt to all new CP production, you would see less vitriolic reactions to your positionI guess that's a pretty soft way of saying it. If it wasn't clear to you before, it should be now. Yes please be clear with your language from the start in the future, I do not want to try to decipher your implied meanings and will take everything you say at face value like any rational human would do. Saying that people would react better to me if I had a proposal to halt all production of CP does not in my mind translate into \"viewing CP could be an effective outlet for pedophiles and lead to lower levels of molestation\", so if that is what you mean then just say it. QuoteBut we're still left with the problem of CP *production* which, regardless of your attempts toward \"seeing the trees\", ignores that those trees currently exist in a putrid and very much thriving forest of suffering and despair. Sure we should cut down the bad trees. I never said that it should be legal for people to molest kids or to produce CP. You want to spray agent orange on the entire god damn forest because some of the trees in it are bad. QuoteThis must be solved or at least positively addressed before we can even begin to have the conversation you're attempting to have. If you don't see this you should really sit quietly for some time and contemplate why, because it is *clearly* true.Talking about ways to prevent the production of CP is largely a different conversation than talking about why it should be legal for people to view CP. The only relationship they have is the studies showing that when people are allowed to view CP, rates of child molestation decrease. You are trying to change the subject, and imply that I argue something I do not (that CP production should be legal), and therefor are kind of engaging in a strawman fallacy.QuotePlease read what I wrote and you quoted again, this time for comprehension. I never said hebe/ephebo-philia are mental illnesses. I said that acting excessively attaching, obsessing over, and acting on those kinds of thoughts are mainfestations of a malfunctioning brain. Ultimately it's the acting that's the real problem here, but the compulsions and obsessions obviously precipitate the actions.The mental health community does not consider acting on hebephilic or ephebophilic desire to be the manifestation of a malfunctioning brain. No mental illness listed in the DSM has attraction to or sex with those ages 14+ listed as a criteria for diagnosis. Sex or fantasies of sex with those 13 and under is a diagnostic criteria for pedophilia, and actual mental illness, the actual manifestation of a malfunctioning brain.   QuoteSee the immediately above, and do try to refrain from obsessing over my (admittedly beautiful) ass.See the immediately above. Having sex with 14+ year olds is not a diagnostic criteria for any \\\\ mental illness recognized by the professional community, it is only seen as a manifestation of mental illness by lay people.  QuoteQuoteQuotePictures of Jews being tortured and killed during the holocaust depict a historical event.Pictures made with cameras inherently depict historical events. Playing games with language isn't going to wrangle you out of this corner. You are intentionally misinterpreting my meaning here, but allow me to restate: \"Pictures of Jews being tortured and killed during the Holocaust depict a significant and recognizable historical period of human history in which millions of humans attempted to systematically and permanently strip an ethnicity of its dignity, livelihood, and erase it altogether.\"How am I playing games with language? You specifically said that a differentiation between pictures of the holocaust and pictures of child molestation is that pictures of the holocaust depict things that happened in the past. I was merely letting you know that all cameras take pictures that depict things in the past, inherently, it is impossible for a camera to take a picture of the immediate present due to the fact that the speed of light is finite, and also the future can not be photographed from the past either. As to your new argument, I already explained that war crimes continue today just as child molestation continues today, and instances of war crimes happened in the past just as instances of child molestation happened in the past. I do not see this differentiation you think you are so clearly showing. QuoteAnd you believe that the intent behind most CP propagation is to teach each other a lesson about the dangers of human potential when compassion is not held as a high virtue?I think in many cases people who are against CP have illegally downloaded CP at some point in their lives and confirmed to themselves why they are against it. In fact, many people on this forum who have condemned others for looking at CP have started their argument against people looking at CP with \"I looked at CP and it was fucking sick, you should not be allowed to look at it!\". But I do not think that it is the primary motivation behind people looking at CP, nope. Do you think if people look at pictures of the holocaust and celebrate them because they are neo Nazis, that they should then be charged with war crimes? Or does it not matter the intent with which a person looks at images of the holocaust with? QuoteYou simply do not get to invoke historical documents of collective/species level atrocities (e.g. Holocaust, war crimes, etc) as being equivalent with those committed against preyed upon individuals (e.g. child pornography). This is veiled domain switching, and it undermines anything you attempt to build upon it before your argument ever leaves the gate. In short, you have failed to carve out a valid starting position upon which your arguments can stand. Fine, forget the holocaust, it is legal to look at the corpse of an individual who was murdered by a serial killer. If I look at such pictures does that make me a serial killer, someone who deserves to go to jail and be treated like a serial killer? What if somebody has a mental illness that causes them to be sexually attracted by dead bodies, if they look at and masturbate to the picture of a person who has been killed be a serial killer, are they then the same as a serial killer? QuoteQuoteChildren continue to be harmed by war crimes.... (the holocaust is an individual historical instance of a behavior)Yeah, and that continues to be wrong too.Yeah, and it continues to be legal to look at the resulting pictures, and nobody thinks we should censor the pictures. QuoteHere you go domain-switching again. You open by referring to a collection of individuals who have already been harmed by saying they are not being harmed by new CP production...COMPLETELY ignoring that there are a continuous flow of NEW individuals being harmed by CP production. You're a smart person, this much is clear. Your empathy, however, leaves much to be desired. This should bother you.You are the one who set the framework. Your claim was that the difference between pictures of the holocaust and pictures of molestation is that pictures of the holocaust were taken in the past and that the people depicted are no longer being executed. My counter argument was that CP pictures were all taken in the past as well, and many of those depicted are no longer at risk of being depicted in child pornography any more. Are you ignoring that there are still new war crimes being carried out, and that NEW individuals are being harmed by NEW war crimes which result in NEW pictures of war crimes? You tried to differentiate two things and failed to do so, that is all. Empathy is something that is good to have just as it is good to have some vitamins in your body. Without any empathy you suffer from a disease. On the other hand, too much empathy is poisonous to your mind, just as having too much of a vitamin in your body is poisonous to your body. Having too much empathy leads people to irrationality and rabidness. Most people could stand to have a bit less empathy, and it would be better for the entire world if people had a bit less empathy. That said, I place the empathy that I have with the people who are being systematically hunted down, imprisoned for decades and labeled as sex offenders for life for merely viewing photographs. I think it is better to try to help these people than it is to try to help people who were molested in the past and who are impossible to help without a time machine. QuoteIf you've successfully made this argument, I have failed to see it. Please point it out to me.You: A differentiation between pictures of CP and pictures of the holocaust is that the holocaust took place in the past and no new people are being affected by it todayMe: Pictures of CP and of the holocaust both took place in the past, and in many instances modern CP production has no affect on those who were depicted in CP in the past, just as modern war crimes have no affect on those who were depicted in the holocaustQuoteHow do you know that these people are not continuously harmed by the propagation of the CP in which they are involved? How do you know that the very fact that CP continues to be produced (i.e. children continue to be abused in this way) is not increasing the suffering of these victims? Where is your support for this claim?Where is your support for the claim that CP production today affects those depicted in CP production of the past? A simple proof of my claim is that some of the people who have been depicted in CP in the past are now dead, so modern production cannot possibly have any affect on them. As for people being continously harmed by the propagation of CP in which they were involved, well I think that this is largely a crock of shit as well. This is a number one argument of those who oppose the legalization of CP viewing. At one end we have the delusional people who say that every time a picture of CP is viewed, the child depicted in the picture is molested all over again. There is not much I can argue with these people because they have no rationality, it is like trying to argue with religious people that God cannot make a rock so big he cannot move it and also move it so therefor he cannot be all powerful. It is impossible to argue with people who disregard reality. On the other hand some of the people who try to be more sophisticated and less obviously retarded try to say that just knowing their CP is being viewed causes stress to the children depicted in the CP. This is an argument I can at least bother trying to argue against, as it is not based on voodoo magic. In these cases I would say that it doesn't matter if people continue to view the CP or not, the child will always have continued stress due to the *possibility* that somebody will view the CP they are depicted in. Let me go back to my PIR example.Some child molester produces CP of Alice and uploads it to an encrypted keyword search server, tagged with keywords that indicate that it is child pornography. When Bob downloads the CP from the encrypted keyword search server, the server cannot tell that Bob is searching for CP or determine the files returned to him. Now Alice knows that she has had CP of her uploaded to this server in the past, and she knows that people could in the future download it, but she is not capable of knowing that Bob downloaded it. I argue that the mere possibility of the child pornography being viewed is what causes stress to Alice, the fact is that Alice is not capable of knowing that Bob downloaded CP featuring her, and she cannot tell if anybody has ever done so. For all she knows nobody ever searched for CP on the encrypted keyword search server, and nobody ever has seen he picture. But this is not going to remove her stress, because for all she knows somebody has downloaded and viewed her CP. The stress of Alice is not caused by Bob downloading CP featuring her, it is caused by the possibility of Bob or anybody else downloading CP featuring her, and this possibility was created by the person who originally took the photograph of Alice. So the cause of Alice's stress is from the producer of CP, not the people who are viewing her CP. If the stress of Alice is from the people viewing her CP and not from the possibility of people viewing her CP, then it makes sense to completely legalize the viewing of CP so that people viewing it are not arrested and Alice is kept from having awareness that people are viewing her CP. Currently the police inform Alice every single time they arrest someone for viewing CP featuring her, and this behavior of the police would according to you be causing a great deal of stress to Alice, and if it is not the possibility of people viewing her CP that causes stress to Alice then it is fine for people to view her CP so long as she never finds out about it (which is why the police should stop telling her).So eitherA. The stress Alice has from the propagation of her CP is the fault of the person who produced the CP, not the fault of the people viewing the CPorB. If the fault is on the people viewing the CP, then it is not the possibility of people viewing the CP that causes Alice stress but her awareness of instances of people viewing her CP, and therefor CP viewing should be legalized to protect Alice from this awarenessQuoteWhich is why I said \"effectively\". I'm not naive enough to think we can stop it completely.So do you want to talk about ways to combat CP production? Because I have some ideas for this as well, but I think this is a somewhat different topic. I think I actually have some good ideas to combat the production of CP though and wouldn't mind sharing them. QuoteAgain the problem is \"where does the CP come from?\". I'm all for destigmatizing hebe/ephebo-philia and possibly even pedophilia in THOUGHT form, and perhaps treatment of the impulses indeed should involve the viewing of CP while under the care of a licensed, scientifically credentialled professional who ultimately bears some responsibility for the actions of the patient.

Its lined with plastic!!After reading all your arguments you are really just a stupid fuck that likes looking at pics of abused kids.Care to share a counter argument, or are you incapable of doing anything other than foaming at the mouth?Also, do you think the ACLU is full of stupid fucks who just like looking at pics of abused kids?Quote\"The ACLU does not support pornography or child porn. However, we do oppose virtually all forms of censorship. Possessing certain books or films, even pornographic ones, should not make one a criminal. Once society starts censoring 'bad or offensive' ideas, it becomes very difficult to draw the line. As the saying goes, 'one man's art is another man’s pornography.' As for child pornography, the ACLU supports the right of the government to prosecute the makers of child pornography for exploiting minors.\"QuoteThe ACLU does not support pornography.  But we do oppose virtually all forms of censorship.  Possessing books or films should not make one a criminal.  Once society starts censoring \"bad\" ideas, it becomes very difficult to draw the line.  Your idea of what is offensive may be a lot different from your neighbors.  The ACLU takes a very purist approach in opposing censorship. Our policy is that possessing pornographic material should not itself be a crime.  The best way to combat child pornography is for the government to prosecute those who exploit children by making pornography and we strongly agree with the enforcement of such prosecutions. QuoteThe ACLU's position is this: criminalize the production but legalize the sale and distribution of child pornography.And I am sure Jacob Appelbaum is just a stupid fuck who likes looking at pictures of kids being abused (if he is so dumb why are you trusting your life to the anonymity and security systems he is a major contributor to??!)Quote> Laws are made for the criminals of society because those who wouldn't> do criminal activity anyway do not need the laws, and indeed do not> usually suffer them until the time comes that someone/s demonstrate a> need for them.> That is really rich.

Please demonstrate or provide evidencefor your claims!One could equally assert without evidence that the production of eroticart and the consumption of legal (say, in the US) pornography reducesadult on adult predatory activity. I bet the Kinsey Institute would haveinteresting data on this very topic but well, since this isn't aconversation based on facts but rather on emotion, I'll not even botherto dig up a citation. If you show some facts for your arguments, I'msure people will bring out data in support of other view points.So please - show us that the existence of abstract material is the soleor even a major contributing factor to an act of non-consensual orotherwise illegal or immoral sexual conduct. Does that currentlynon-existent data support your argument? Would it support your argumentfor other kinds of abuse?Does evidence of a killing, such as Oscar Grant's murder in Oakland,California[0] by the BART police make other police want to killcivilians? Or does it make people want justice for the death of OscarGrant? One might argue that the evidence will actually reduce thechances that another cop will get to say he meant to pull a stun gun.Documentation seems to very seriously change the human rights abusersposition of power - be it the police or other groups that derive asubject's compliance through forced violence.Or put another more simple way - the problem with child porn is not the*evidence* of the crime alone, it is that people are actually harming aliving being. The murder of a guy, such as what happened in OscarGrant's case, is pretty disturbing - shall we erase that crime from thearchives of history because journalists claim protection under the FirstAmendment protections? Why should we create a special class ofinformation that we flush down the memory hole, where only specialpeople are allowed to look at it, to judge it and where merely beingaccused of being near it is a (cultural) death sentence?All the best,Jacobhttps://twitter.com/ioerror/status/245056647133818880QuoteThanks for writing this article. I think the law is more complex in the US than you’ve written – as I think that some states make different distinctions and the prosecution has discretion that varies by jurisdiction.As a Tor developer, I’ve been attacked for supporting an absolute right to read and an absolute right to speak. No exceptions of any kind should be built into the fabric of our networks or into the fabric of our societies. Prior restraint is wrong, flatly. I’ve made a similar argument to the one presented in your article during public lectures, usually during Q&A time, as a response to extremely angry people in the audience. It usually feels like they haven’t thought things through.It is important to drive home the point of similar cases where a video is in itself horrible but the crime captured is important to expose. As an example, I present a video. It’s absolutely terrible – a person mulling around during a protest with a red shirt is shot in the head; his brain spills out onto the ground and he appears to die instantly. Here is the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpIol2xBPQQSo, what is the problem here exactly?The problem is not just the video tape of a Thai King’s sniper killing a person, it is the sniper who kills a person. The video is also presents a problem. It presents evidence that seems to compel people and it moves people to anger or sickness. Those that see the video, I think, should feel the need to take action about the actual crimes documented in the video!That video is evidence of the sniper’s crimes and to censor it is to take the last moments of the victim and to snuff them out entirely. Again. What could be more despicable than to forever silence the truth about a person unjustly murdered by a monarch and his sniper thugs?I find it hard to imagine but actually, your article drives it home: the thing more despicable is to systematize it in the form of censorship and to do it in the name of protection; who gains with the video I presented? The tyrant king and his violent murderers.How many murdering military snipers, abusive cops or monarch’s thugs are on the internet? After the Occupy videos I’ve seen, I’m guessing it is non-zero and likely higher than the total number of child pornographers in absolute numbers. Though I admit, I wouldn’t be surprised by an overlapping set of assholes in those two sets.Do we ever hear about needing censorship of the internet based on those known internet using criminals and their often well documented crimes? No, not seriously. We rarely, if ever, even hear about accountability thanks to the Blue Shield.It sounds odd but I think, rightfully we shouldn’t make such an argument seriously. Everyone has a right to speak, even alleged murdering snipers – they also have a right to a fair trial, where evidence, such as the video above, will be used as evidence in an attempt to bring justice. To ensure that justice is created, we must know about the crimes committed against humanity.We must not shy away from it, that which is so terrible to see and even more terrible, I imagine, to experience. Nor should we destroy the greatest medium for sharing those potential truths that the world has ever seen and certainly not to benefit profiteers, kings or murderers.Oh yeah and what about the Swedish Pirate Party? They are just sick fuck pedophiles right:falkvinge.net/2012/09/07/three-reasons-child-porn-must-be-re-legalized-in-the-coming-decadeQuoteChild pornography is a toxic subject, but a very important one that cannot and should not be ignored. This is an attempt to bring the topic to a serious discussion, and explain why possession of child pornography need to be re-legalized in the next ten years, and why you need to fight for it to happen.And the entire libertarian party of the USA is just full of sick fuck pedophiles who want to jack off to pictures of kids being abused right?http://www.thepolitic.com/archives/2008/04/25/libertarian-presidential-front-runner-defends-child-porn/QuoteMary Ruwart, research scientist, perrenial Libertarian Senatorial candidate and front runner for this year’s Libertarian Presidential ticket is being taken to task for comments she made in her book, Short Answers to Tough Questions.When discussing self choice in relation to child porn, she had this to say: “Children who willingly participate in sexual acts have the right to make that decision as well, even if it’s distasteful to us personally. Some children will make poor choices just as some adults do in smoking and drinking to excess. When we outlaw child pornography, the prices paid for child performers rise, increasing the incentives for parents to use children against their will.”Yeah all of the people fighting for freedom are just total child rapist sick fucks, damn you found us all out! The people who are fighting for your right to use drugs are also fighting for pedophiles right to view child porn. Calling us sick fuck child molesters is funny considering we are the ones making the tools you use to maintain your own freedom, fighting for your own freedom, and standing up to society and the government on your behalf. You are just a selfish fucktard who wants freedom for yourself but slavery for others. \n",

      "Quote from: kmfkewm on August 23, 2013, 08:58 pmBut if you look at the pictures of children being molested, you are certainly causing them to be molested all over again, and the demand for these pictures is the sole cause of child molestation.Child Pornography, is pornography, correct?**I once had a friend who was seriously hurt because he jumped down the stairs at a theater after watching a movie where an action star jumped off buildings. (Hey, I didn’t say it was my smartest friend, I just said it was a friend.) That may sound crazy, but because of the way we learn, it’s really not.The thing is, everyone’s brain is wired to repeat what it sees and hears; it’s a major part of how we learn. And the more senses you get involved in the learning process, the more consistent the message, and the more often you see it, the more likely you are to be influenced by it (30). That’s just one more reason why viewing pornography is dangerous. It’s a short jump from using pornography to imitating what you’re seeing. And just like my friend, sometimes imitating the things you see can really hurt yourself and other people.Did you know that there’s been a correlation found between people who view pornography and people who commit sexual crimes? Now I’m not saying that viewing pornography will make you go on a sexual crime rampage, but the way pornography affects you, it can influence your judgment and be connected with sexual violence.Proving this point is kind of tough, because an accurate study “would require a sampling of much more than a thousand males, exposed to pornography through puberty and adolescence, while the other group is totally isolated from it’s influence in all its forms and varying degrees. Each group would then have to be monitored—through the commission of violent crimes or not” (1).See what I mean? It’s kind of a tough study to set up. “In spite of the lack of formal research, though, the FBI’s own statistics show that pornography is found at 80 percent of the scenes of violent sex crimes, or in the homes of the perpetrators” (1). Now I think that’s kind of tough to ignore.The people who promote pornography think that’s actually easy to ignore. They say either that pornography is harmless, or that there isn’t “conclusive scientific data” that pornography causes sex crimes to justify suppressing pornography. Sounds about right coming from someone who stands to make a profit in the industry. The fact is that the “conclusive scientific data” they’re talking about isn’t really necessary. There’s enough evidence, like the stuff from the FBI, to prove that there’s a link between pornography and sex crimes.In fact, here’s a bunch of evidence about that link:* The University of New Hampshire did a study that showed that the states with the highest readership of pornographic magazines like Playboy and Penthouse, also have the highest rape rates (2).*The Michigan State Police Department found that pornography is used or imitated in 41 percent of the sex crimes they have investigated (3).*Dr. Victor Cline did research that showed how men who become addicted to pornographic materials begin to want more explicit or deviant material and end up acting out what they have seen (5).* Now this one will make your skin crawl—Dr. James Dobson interviewed Ted Bundy, one of the nation’s most notorious serial killers, on the day before his execution. Bundy said that the “most damaging kinds of pornography are those that involve sexual violence . . . The wedding of those two forces, as I know only too well, brings about behavior that is just, just too terrible to describe” (1).*Two doctors noted in their research-based book, Pornography and Sexual Aggression, that “Certain [aggressive] forms of pornography can affect aggressive attitudes toward women and can desensitize an individual’s perception of rape. These attitudes and perceptions are, furthermore, directly related to actual aggressive behavior against women.” They also found that adult pornography was connected with each of the 1,400 child sexual molestation cases in Louisville, Kentucky, and child pornography was connected with the majority of them (21).*Another review of controlled studies found that extensive viewing of the type of pornographic material commonly sold at adult bookstores was positively correlated with an increased self-reported willingness to commit rape or other forced sexual acts (28).*The Kingston Sexual Offenders Clinic in Canada found “an unexpected finding” when they conducted a study of their patients over a period of six years. “One of the rapists reported that he used consenting sex depictions to incite rape images in the process of preparing himself to attack a woman. Subsequent questioning revealed a further five rapists who made similar claims, and 10 of the 10 rapists who currently used (pornography) for enjoyment (not necessarily preparatory to offending) also said they used it to incite rape fantasies (22).*Another study says that a non-rapist population will show increased sexual arousal after having been exposed to “media-presented images of rape,” especially when the female victim demonstrates signs of pleasure and arousal. This exposure, they further claim, may also lead to a lessened sensitivity toward rape, acceptance of rape myths, and increased self-reported likelihood of raping and self-generated rape fantasies (11)(12).*Dr. Dolf Zillman and Dr. Jennings Bryant showed that continued exposure to pornography had serious negative effects on beliefs about sexuality in general(sounds like kmfkewm), and on attitudes toward women in particular. They also found that pornography desensitizes people to rape as a criminal offense, and that massive exposure to pornography encourages a desire for increasingly deviant materials that depict violence (such as sadomasochism and rape) (29).* Individuals with a predisposition for aggression (i.e., men who are at relatively high risk for aggression) have shown to be particularly drawn to images of pornography and are more likely to expose themselves to such images in the future than lower-risk individuals. Moreover, a number of priming studies have shown that men with earlier risk characteristics may interpret sexually explicit material differently than lower-risk individuals, such that pornography activates and reinforces inappropriate cognitive representations (e.g., hostility toward women) and fosters the development of sexual preoccupation in these men (14).*A review study based on 81 research studies (35 using aggressive porn stimuli and 46 using non-aggressive porn stimuli), concluded that “the empirical research on the effects of aggressive pornography shows, with impressive consistency, that exposure to these materials has a negative effect on attitudes toward women and the perceived likelihood to rape.” The study also noted that 70 percent of the 46 non-aggressive studies reported clear evidence of negative effects of exposure (25).*A meta-analysis, using the results of 24 original experimental studies, found that “violence within the pornography is not necessary to increase the acceptance of ‘rape myths’ (i.e., the myth that women secretly desire to be raped).” The study noted that the link between acceptance of rape myths and exposure to pornography stems from a simple premise—“that most pornography commodifies sex, that women become objects used for male pleasure, and that as objects of desire, they are to be acted on” (25).*A study for the Canadian Department of Justice found that when they exposed individuals who were habitually “high-frequency porn consumers” to non-violent, dehumanizing porn, those individuals were particularly likely to report that they might rape, were more sexually callous, and reported engaging in more acts of sexual aggression. The authors noted that the porn the individuals were exposed to was the kind that may in fact be most prevalent in mainstream commercial entertainment videos. The study found that more than twice as many men indicated at least some likelihood of raping after exposure to this material—20.4 percent of those who were exposed, versus 9.4 percent of those who weren’t exposed (25).*Another review of a series of studies of “common pornography” found that its consumption led to insensitivity towards victims of sexual violence, trivialization of rape as a criminal offense, trivialization of sexual child abuse as a criminal offense, increased belief that lack of sexual activity leads to health risks and increased acceptance of pre and extra-marital sexuality. The study noted, “habitual male consumers of common pornography appear to be at greater risk of becoming sexually callous towards female sexuality and concerns” (25).You can see that there’s tons of info that backs up the connection between viewing porn and committing sex crimes. But, just so you get both sides of the issue, the porn pushers think they have evidence to support their point too. Here are the studies they always talk about:*Berl Kutchinsky of Denmark studied the countries of Denmark, Sweden, West Germany, and the U.S.A. Kutchinsky showed that for the years 1964 to 1984, as the pornography became increasingly available, the rate of rapes in these countries either decreased, or remained relatively stable. These countries all legalized or decriminalized pornography in 1969, 1970, and 1973 respectfully. The rates of nonsexual violent crimes and nonviolent sex crimes (e.g., peeping and flashing) essentially decreased also. Only in the U.S. did it appear that in the 1970s and 1980s, as porn became increasingly available, that rape appeared to increase (5)(15)(16)(17)(18)(5). The theory Kutchinsky came up with based on his studies is that the easy availability of pornography had caused sex crimes to decrease by acting as a “safety-valve” for potential offenders.*Studies of Croatioa and Shanghai, China also showed significant decreases in rape as pornography became increasingly available. To add to this data, it should be mentioned that yet unpublished studies from Poland, Finland, and the Czech Republic also similarly found that as the availability of pornography increased, the incidence of sex crimes decreased (7)( 8 )(9)(10)(19).                                                                 So what’s the catch? Why is there support for both sides? Well, the porn pushers love to talk about these studies because they seem to validate their points. What they don’t like to talk about is how the people who have since reviewed these studies have found some major flaws in the conclusions. It turns out that there are a couple of things that distorted the results:First of all, at the same time that pornography was legalized in all of those countries, a lot of other sex crimes including peeping, “indecency towards women,” and certain types of incest, were also made legal. So with those things no longer considered a crime, it’s no wonder the crime rates dropped.Second, Kutchinsky put rape in the same category as less serious sex crimes. That made it easier to hide the fact that serious crimes like rape actually increased after pornography was legalized in Denmark (5).Porn advocates also don’t like to talk much about the results of studies in Sweden, Great Britain, New Zealand, and Australia, where the number of rapes increased when the constraints on the availability of pornography were lifted. Like how “when South Australia liberalized its laws on pornography and Queensland maintained its conservative policy . . . the number of rapes in Queensland remained at the same low level while South Australia’s showed a six fold increase” over a 13 year period (25).There are some other things too that pro-pornography people like to say to discount the connection between pornography and sexual crime. Some people say it’s the characteristics of the people involved in sexual crime that matters more than the availability of pornography (1)(26)(27). Other researchers basically suggest that aggressive images rather than sexual images may be the primary instigation toward sexual offense (11)(12). Others reviewing the relation of aggression to sexual assault conclude it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes to increased sexual assault behavior and “may actually provide a catharsis to alleviate sexual aggression” (13). A lot of people call this the “Cathartic Theory.” (So, mostly it’s just a lot of “scientist people” that call it that. I mean, when was the last time you heard one of your friends talk about the Cathartic Theory?)But no matter what people say to try to try and make pornography seem good or harmless, there’s enough evidence out there that says it’s not, especially when it’s in the wrong hands. With porn being so easy to find, affordable, and accessible, you’ve got to know what you’re up against. Learn the facts about the negative affects of porn—all of them, there’s way more than just the link between porn and sexual crime—and you’ll think twice before looking at it.                                                                                                                                                            Sources:(1) Anderson, K.J.

      "Quote*Dr. Victor Cline did research that showed how men who become addicted to pornographic materials begin to want more explicit or deviant material and end up acting out what they have seen (5).It is controversial if pornography addiction leads to a desire for more and more explicit material, and progression is not required by most standards to qualify for addiction to pornography, however I do think that progression is a common characteristic of pornography addiction, and many who view CP are actually not pedophiles but rather are pornography addicts. As far as acting out what they have seen, that is highly controversial as well, and would link to the \"media and its effect on violence\" as well as \"access to violent pornography leads to lower rates of sexual violence\" studies. Quote* Now this one will make your skin crawl—Dr. James Dobson interviewed Ted Bundy, one of the nation’s most notorious serial killers, on the day before his execution. Bundy said that the “most damaging kinds of pornography are those that involve sexual violence . . . The wedding of those two forces, as I know only too well, brings about behavior that is just, just too terrible to describe” (1).Lol, funny that they quote Ted Bundy. Bundy was a sociopath he was trying to manipulate his interviewers when he discussed the effect pornography had on him, sociopaths are well known for such manipulations:https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ted_BundyQuoteMultiple biographers,[314][315][316] researchers,[317] and other observers[318] have concluded that Bundy's sudden condemnation of pornography was one last manipulative attempt to shift blame by catering to Dobson's agenda as a longtime anti-pornography advocate, telling him precisely what he wanted to hear.[319] While he asserted in the Dobson interview that detective magazines and other reading material had \"corrupted\" him and \"fueled [his] fantasies ... to the point of becoming a serial killer\", in a 1977 letter to Ann Rule he wrote, \"Who in the world reads these publications? ... I have never purchased such a magazine, and [on only] two or three occasions have I ever picked one up.\"[320] He told Michaud and Aynsworth in 1980, and Hagmaier the night before he spoke to Dobson, that pornography played a negligible role in his development as a serial killer.[321] \"The problem wasn't pornography,\" wrote Dekle. \"The problem was Bundy.\"[322]Quote*Two doctors noted in their research-based book, Pornography and Sexual Aggression, that “Certain [aggressive] forms of pornography can affect aggressive attitudes toward women and can desensitize an individual’s perception of rape. These attitudes and perceptions are, furthermore, directly related to actual aggressive behavior against women.” They also found that adult pornography was connected with each of the 1,400 child sexual molestation cases in Louisville, Kentucky, and child pornography was connected with the majority of them (21).Highly controversialQuote*Another review of controlled studies found that extensive viewing of the type of pornographic material commonly sold at adult bookstores was positively correlated with an increased self-reported willingness to commit rape or other forced sexual acts (28).Highly controversial contradicts other studies that access to violent pronography reduce rates of sexual violence. Quote*The Kingston Sexual Offenders Clinic in Canada found “an unexpected finding” when they conducted a study of their patients over a period of six years. “One of the rapists reported that he used consenting sex depictions to incite rape images in the process of preparing himself to attack a woman. Subsequent questioning revealed a further five rapists who made similar claims, and 10 of the 10 rapists who currently used (pornography) for enjoyment (not necessarily preparatory to offending) also said they used it to incite rape fantasies (22).Rapists fantasize about rape when looking at pornography, so what. Quote*Another study says that a non-rapist population will show increased sexual arousal after having been exposed to “media-presented images of rape,” especially when the female victim demonstrates signs of pleasure and arousal. This exposure, they further claim, may also lead to a lessened sensitivity toward rape, acceptance of rape myths, and increased self-reported likelihood of raping and self-generated rape fantasies (11)(12).Females have more rape fantasies than anyone else, it is the third most popular female fantasy:http://www.care2.com/causes/rape-ranked-as-third-most-popular-sexual-fantasy-for-women.htmlQuoteRape Ranked as Third Most Popular Sexual Fantasy for Womendo you think this means all of these females want to be raped in reality? Oh wait that is impossible. It is impossible to want to be raped because being raped means you don't want it to happen. That paradox shows the clear separation between fantasy and reality, just as many of the people who look at child porn don't actually want to rape children outside of their fantasies. Quote*Dr. Dolf Zillman and Dr. Jennings Bryant showed that continued exposure to pornography had serious negative effects on beliefs about sexuality in general(sounds like kmfkewm), and on attitudes toward women in particular. They also found that pornography desensitizes people to rape as a criminal offense, and that massive exposure to pornography encourages a desire for increasingly deviant materials that depict violence (such as sadomasochism and rape) (29).I will say probably repeated exposure to pornography causes a desire for more extreme pornography, at least in those addicted to pornography. However, this is highly controversial, as are all of the other points Dr. Dolf made. Quote* Individuals with a predisposition for aggression (i.e., men who are at relatively high risk for aggression) have shown to be particularly drawn to images of pornography and are more likely to expose themselves to such images in the future than lower-risk individuals. Moreover, a number of priming studies have shown that men with earlier risk characteristics may interpret sexually explicit material differently than lower-risk individuals, such that pornography activates and reinforces inappropriate cognitive representations (e.g., hostility toward women) and fosters the development of sexual preoccupation in these men (14).Almost all men are into porn of one sort or another: http://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/sex/6709646/All-men-watch-porn-scientists-find.htmlQuote Researchers were conducting a study comparing the views of men in their 20s who had never been exposed to pornography with regular users.But their project stumbled at the first hurdle when they failed to find a single man who had not been seen it.“We started our research seeking men in their 20s who had never consumed pornography,” said Professor Simon Louis Lajeunesse. “We couldn't find any.” Quote*A review study based on 81 research studies (35 using aggressive porn stimuli and 46 using non-aggressive porn stimuli), concluded that “the empirical research on the effects of aggressive pornography shows, with impressive consistency, that exposure to these materials has a negative effect on attitudes toward women and the perceived likelihood to rape.” The study also noted that 70 percent of the 46 non-aggressive studies reported clear evidence of negative effects of exposure (25).I am not going to keep repeating myself, but yeah I already gave links showing that these claims are highly controversial and hotly contested, as well as links showing that much of the research making such claims has been found to be biased and not legitimate. Quote*A study for the Canadian Department of Justice found that when they exposed individuals who were habitually “high-frequency porn consumers” to non-violent, dehumanizing porn, those individuals were particularly likely to report that they might rape, were more sexually callous, and reported engaging in more acts of sexual aggression. The authors noted that the porn the individuals were exposed to was the kind that may in fact be most prevalent in mainstream commercial entertainment videos. The study found that more than twice as many men indicated at least some likelihood of raping after exposure to this material—20.4 percent of those who were exposed, versus 9.4 percent of those who weren’t exposed (25).Those statistics seem fishy considering that 35% of college aged men say they might rape if they knew they would get away with ithttp://www.uic.edu/depts/owa/sa_rape_support.htmlQuote- In a survey of male college students:· 35% anonymously admitted that, under certain circumstances, they would commit rape if they believed they could get away with it (ref 6,7). QuoteYou can see that there’s tons of info that backs up the connection between viewing porn and committing sex crimes. But, just so you get both sides of the issue, the porn pushers think they have evidence to support their point too. Here are the studies they always talk about:Well, even in the social sciences the things this crazy Christian fundamentalist is talking about are highly controversial.QuoteWell, the porn pushers love to talk about these studies because they seem to validate their points. What they don’t like to talk about is how the people who have since reviewed these studies have found some major flaws in the conclusions. It turns out that there are a couple of things that distorted the results:Well, as my previous links show, the studies that this person is giving links to have also been reviewed and found to have major flaws in them. QuoteFirst of all, at the same time that pornography was legalized in all of those countries, a lot of other sex crimes including peeping, “indecency towards women,” and certain types of incest, were also made legal. So with those things no longer considered a crime, it’s no wonder the crime rates dropped.I guess we will need to look at the raw statistics then? Regardless in the study I linked to it mentioned only child sex abuse crimes not all sex crimesQuoteAnd most significantly, the incidence of child sex abuse has fallen considerably since 1989, when child pornography became readily accessible – a phenomenon also seen in Denmark and Japan. TQuoteSecond, Kutchinsky put rape in the same category as less serious sex crimes. That made it easier to hide the fact that serious crimes like rape actually increased after pornography was legalized in Denmark (5).well as the above link shows, he only claimed that child sex abuse fell after access to child pornography was made possible. So there is no trickery going on with that statistic! QuoteBut no matter what people say to try to try and make pornography seem good or harmless, there’s enough evidence out there that says it’s not, especially when it’s in the wrong hands.There is a lot of evidence that says pornography leads to lower rates of sexual violence and child pornography leads to lower rates of child sex abuse as well. http://www.uic.edu/depts/owa/sa_rape_support.htmlQuoteThe effects of pornography, whether violent or non-violent, on sexual aggression have been debated decades. The current review examines evidence about the influence of pornography on sexual aggression incorrelational and experimental studies and in real world violent crime data. Evidence for a causalrelationship between exposure to pornography and sexual aggression is slim and may, at certain times, havebeen exaggerated by politicians, pressure groups and some social scientists. Some of the debate has focusedon violent pornography, but evidence of any negative effects is inconsistent, and violent pornography iscomparatively rare in the real world. Victimization rates for rape in the United States demonstrate an inverserelationship between pornography consumption and rape rates. Data from other nations have suggestedsimilar relationships. Although these data cannot be used to determine that pornography has a catharticeffect on rape behavior, combined with the weak evidence in support of negative causal hypotheses from thescientific literature, it is concluded that it is time to discard the hypothesis that pornography contributes toincreased sexual assault behavior.                                                                                                                                                                     \n",

However, we do oppose virtually all forms of censorship. Possessing certain books or films, even pornographic ones, should not make one a criminal. Once society starts censoring 'bad or offensive' ideas, it becomes very difficult to draw the line. As the saying goes, 'one man's art is another man’s pornography.'

Our policy is that possessing pornographic material should not itself be a crime.  The best way to combat child pornography is for the government to prosecute those who exploit children by making pornography and we strongly agree with the enforcement of such prosecutions. QuoteThe ACLU's position is this: criminalize the production but legalize the sale and distribution of child pornography.And I am sure Jacob Appelbaum is just a stupid fuck who likes looking at pictures of kids being abused (if he is so dumb why are you trusting your life to the anonymity and security systems he is a major contributor to??!)Quote> Laws are made for the criminals of society because those who wouldn't> do criminal activity anyway do not need the laws, and indeed do not> usually suffer them until the time comes that someone/s demonstrate a> need for them.> That is really rich.

Please demonstrate or provide evidencefor your claims!One could equally assert without evidence that the production of eroticart and the consumption of legal (say, in the US) pornography reducesadult on adult predatory activity. I bet the Kinsey Institute would haveinteresting data on this very topic but well, since this isn't aconversation based on facts but rather on emotion, I'll not even botherto dig up a citation. If you show some facts for your arguments, I'msure people will bring out data in support of other view points.So please - show us that the existence of abstract material is the soleor even a major contributing factor to an act of non-consensual orotherwise illegal or immoral sexual conduct. Does that currentlynon-existent data support your argument? Would it support your argumentfor other kinds of abuse?Does evidence of a killing, such as Oscar Grant's murder in Oakland,California[0] by the BART police make other police want to killcivilians? Or does it make people want justice for the death of OscarGrant? One might argue that the evidence will actually reduce thechances that another cop will get to say he meant to pull a stun gun.Documentation seems to very seriously change the human rights abusersposition of power - be it the police or other groups that derive asubject's compliance through forced violence.Or put another more simple way - the problem with child porn is not the*evidence* of the crime alone, it is that people are actually harming aliving being. The murder of a guy, such as what happened in OscarGrant's case, is pretty disturbing - shall we erase that crime from thearchives of history because journalists claim protection under the FirstAmendment protections? Why should we create a special class ofinformation that we flush down the memory hole, where only specialpeople are allowed to look at it, to judge it and where merely beingaccused of being near it is a (cultural) death sentence?All the best,Jacobhttps://twitter.com/ioerror/status/245056647133818880QuoteThanks for writing this article. I think the law is more complex in the US than you’ve written – as I think that some states make different distinctions and the prosecution has discretion that varies by jurisdiction.As a Tor developer, I’ve been attacked for supporting an absolute right to read and an absolute right to speak. No exceptions of any kind should be built into the fabric of our networks or into the fabric of our societies. Prior restraint is wrong, flatly. I’ve made a similar argument to the one presented in your article during public lectures, usually during Q&A time, as a response to extremely angry people in the audience. It usually feels like they haven’t thought things through.It is important to drive home the point of similar cases where a video is in itself horrible but the crime captured is important to expose. As an example, I present a video. It’s absolutely terrible – a person mulling around during a protest with a red shirt is shot in the head; his brain spills out onto the ground and he appears to die instantly. Here is the video: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mpIol2xBPQQSo, what is the problem here exactly?The problem is not just the video tape of a Thai King’s sniper killing a person, it is the sniper who kills a person. The video is also presents a problem. It presents evidence that seems to compel people and it moves people to anger or sickness. Those that see the video, I think, should feel the need to take action about the actual crimes documented in the video!That video is evidence of the sniper’s crimes and to censor it is to take the last moments of the victim and to snuff them out entirely. Again. What could be more despicable than to forever silence the truth about a person unjustly murdered by a monarch and his sniper thugs?I find it hard to imagine but actually, your article drives it home: the thing more despicable is to systematize it in the form of censorship and to do it in the name of protection; who gains with the video I presented? The tyrant king and his violent murderers.How many murdering military snipers, abusive cops or monarch’s thugs are on the internet? After the Occupy videos I’ve seen, I’m guessing it is non-zero and likely higher than the total number of child pornographers in absolute numbers. Though I admit, I wouldn’t be surprised by an overlapping set of assholes in those two sets.Do we ever hear about needing censorship of the internet based on those known internet using criminals and their often well documented crimes? No, not seriously. We rarely, if ever, even hear about accountability thanks to the Blue Shield.It sounds odd but I think, rightfully we shouldn’t make such an argument seriously. Everyone has a right to speak, even alleged murdering snipers – they also have a right to a fair trial, where evidence, such as the video above, will be used as evidence in an attempt to bring justice. To ensure that justice is created, we must know about the crimes committed against humanity.We must not shy away from it, that which is so terrible to see and even more terrible, I imagine, to experience. Nor should we destroy the greatest medium for sharing those potential truths that the world has ever seen and certainly not to benefit profiteers, kings or murderers.Oh yeah and what about the Swedish Pirate Party? They are just sick fuck pedophiles right:falkvinge.net/2012/09/07/three-reasons-child-porn-must-be-re-legalized-in-the-coming-decadeQuoteChild pornography is a toxic subject, but a very important one that cannot and should not be ignored. This is an attempt to bring the topic to a serious discussion, and explain why possession of child pornography need to be re-legalized in the next ten years, and why you need to fight for it to happen.And the entire libertarian party of the USA is just full of sick fuck pedophiles who want to jack off to pictures of kids being abused right?http://www.thepolitic.com/archives/2008/04/25/libertarian-presidential-front-runner-defends-child-porn/QuoteMary Ruwart, research scientist, perrenial Libertarian Senatorial candidate and front runner for this year’s Libertarian Presidential ticket is being taken to task for comments she made in her book, Short Answers to Tough Questions.When discussing self choice in relation to child porn, she had this to say: “Children who willingly participate in sexual acts have the right to make that decision as well, even if it’s distasteful to us personally. Some children will make poor choices just as some adults do in smoking and drinking to excess. When we outlaw child pornography, the prices paid for child performers rise, increasing the incentives for parents to use children against their will.”Yeah all of the people fighting for freedom are just total child rapist sick fucks, damn you found us all out! The people who are fighting for your right to use drugs are also fighting for pedophiles right to view child porn. Calling us sick fuck child molesters is funny considering we are the ones making the tools you use to maintain your own freedom, fighting for your own freedom, and standing up to society and the government on your behalf. You are just a selfish fucktard who wants freedom for yourself but slavery for others.Its hard to argue with a stupid fuck without a shread of empathy and I am far from foaming at the mouth.ACUL whoever the fuck can go fuck themselves too. I dont need to be part of, thank, support any group fighting for my freedom to use or distribute drugs.You're so up yourself. You are concerned about everyones freedom including mine.Well Im here to fight for the freedom of the children in the picturesEveryone close to me, my family, friends all know I use drugs. What about you? Does your mum know you like/support child pornography??Ever wonder why they segregate you cunts from the rest of the prison population?

But anyway I can already easily prove that supply and demand is not what has you so bothered. Are you okay with CP being downloaded via Private Information Retrieval? What if there is a system where nobody can tell the demand for certain content, yet anybody can download and view the content? There is no more demand that can be recognized, so that means that it is fine, since your problem is with supply and demand, right? This argument is already solved. If we are so concerned about the unproven supply and demand of CP theory, we should build a PIR based system for pedophiles to be able to download CP from. Nobody can tell the demand anymore, it is not an issue. Right?QuoteIm not going to read 24 pages of you explaining why its ok to want to look at pics of little boy buttholes. If there is a fucking demand for kiddie porn there will be an increase in kids being violated. This is probably not true, in that people do not decide to violate kids simply because some fucking random person on the internet downloaded some CP, but even assuming that it is true (it probably isn't), there are technical solutions to take care of this problem. So please if you would like to continue to argue, at least have something fresh that doesn't already have a solution for it. Because we can take care of any possibility of demand leading to more supply, via cryptographically masking demand. QuoteThere is research to support any bullshit theory any fuckhead dreams up. So if we don't go off research what should we go off of? Primitive emotional responses?QuoteYou have some sort of disconnect in your brain that directs you towards kids. No I am actually quite normal. Research (I know I know, you hate research and science) demonstrates that normal men have the same sexual response to those 13+ as they do to those 18+. There are tools for measuring sexual arousal. Experiments have been done. Normal men are sexually aroused by 13 year olds for fucks sake. Nothing is wrong with my brain, something is wrong with your brain that makes you feel a compulsion to lie to yourself and to others. You can say whatever you want and maybe you even have convinced yourself, but I have facts on my side and you have nothing at all ! QuoteKids are helpless, you can more easily have your way with them than an adult. I get it. You were picked on or abused as a kid and this is your way of feeling powerful. I get that. Dude get counseling, its not ok. Its not normal or natural.Dude. Pictures. Of. Kids. Are. Not. Motherfucking. Kids. Jesus christ is that so hard of a concept for you to understand? Or if you are talking about how I think the age of consent should be lowered, well, yeah I think USA should lower its age of consent to be the same as Croatia the same as Germany the same as Japan maybe even. Is that such a horrible thing? Am I such a broken horrible person because I think the age of consent laws in Germany make more sense? Are these countries just full of pedophiles have they just been taken over by sick vile pedophiles who must be castrated and executed?

His subjects were 48 young Czech soldiers, all presumed to be ‘‘normal’’and heterosexual in orientation. He showed the men pictures of children (ages 4–10years old), adolescents (ages 12–16), and adults (ages 17–36). As expected, most of theheterosexual men were sexually aroused by photos of both adult and adolescentfemales. They were not aroused by pictures of males of any age, and were aroused at anintermediate level by pictures of children (Freund & Costell, 1970).   This unsurprising tendency of normal heterosexual men to be sexually aroused byadolescents was confirmed by other researchers. Like Freund, a group of researchers inCanada was attempting to perfect physiological tools for measuring sexual arousal.These researchers found that their instruments could distinguish between the arousalpatterns of child molesters and a control group exposed to slides of female children(ages 5–11), but both groups showed similar arousal patterns to slides of pubescent girls(ages 12–15) (Quinsey, Steinman, Bergerson, & Holmes, 1975).The difference between all men and predator IS a normal man will see a teenage girl for what she really is. Emotionally immature, vulnerable. A normal man may be aroused read may be, but that is it, he doesnt seek out CP. pics of abused or non consensual content or even consensual pictures of emotionally, vulnerable children for their pleasure.Why? Because a normal man will see a CP pic for what it is. A child that has been taken advantage of. a child in pain, a child that will have to carry the emotional scars for the rest of their lives. They wont see a pic of a child to satisfy a sick urge. They will be repulsed, sickened.Am I aroused by 14 year old girls? Maybe once or twice I have thought a young girl is attractive,but then an overwhelming urge fills me to protect that child. to kill predators.I highly doubt that if a normal man looks at a picture of some 14 year old girl flashing her damn mirror that they are going to be sickened and repulsed by it. It just seems incredibly unlikely. Furthermore, if they look at such pictures or not, it has absolutely zero effect on the pictured teenager. None at all, nada, absolutely no effect. To think otherwise is to think that photographs have a magical property that has never been demonstrated, never been observed, never been explained. Please show me links to the research showing the magical properties of photographs and how viewing them can cause effects to happen to those depicted in them. These is no such research, it isn't real, it isn't even worthy of thinking about because it is so disconnected from reality as to be absolutely absurd! A normal man *will* be aroused, read *will*, man there have been fucking studies done it isn't a matter of debate it is a matter of hooking random selections of men up to arousal reading equipment and noticing that they have the same exact level of arousal to young teenagers as they do to adults. It isn't a matter of debate at this point, studies have been done, science has been carried out, we have an indisputable conclusion, normal men have the same level of sexual attraction to young teenagers as they do to those in their twenties and thirties! It isn't even an unexpected resultQuoteAs expected, most of theheterosexual men were sexually aroused by photos of both adult and adolescentfemales.It would be mind blowing if the average male wasn't attracted to adolescents! And you think a 14 or 15 year old is so vulnerable but not a 16 year old they are fine. Or not an 18 year old, they are fine. It is just nonsense, some arbitrary number that a bunch of religious wack-a-doos and feminists came up with in the late 19th century based on absolutely no science or jack diddly-shit. And since their global campaign to raise the age of consent to this number, people have been slowly brainwashed in the process, and we can see the result of this brainwashing quite clearly in this thread. Men deny that they are attracted to teenagers under the age of 18, despite the fact that some 14 year olds and some 18 year olds look to be exactly the same age, even to fucking forensic development specialists! We have men lying about their attraction to teenagers but the sexual arousal studies are not lying. And big surprise at that for most of human history it has been acceptable to be attracted to young teenagers and even to have sex with them and marry them! Only after the late 19th century did attitudes on this matter start to shift, and they shifted because of the goals of religious and feminist organizations. The amount of logical fallacies coming from those who are trying to argue with me is just insane, we have people saying that it should be legal to look at pictures that it should be illegal to look at, people saying all kinds of insane shit. A lot of people in this thread seem to think that the global age of consent is already 18 and that it is illegal to view CP in the entire world! All of this is the hallmark of massive and intense indoctrination, and it sucks that you are too far gone to even realize the truth.Also maybe once or twice you have thought a young girl is attractive haha dude cut the bullshit. You are not fooling me, I have read the research I have read the reasoning behind why men are attracted to young teenagers, you are not fooling anybody. For one you cannot even reliably tell a 14/15 year old girl from an 18 year old girl by looking at her, she could be an older looking 14 year old or a younger looking 18 year old. For two, you are hard wired to find girls of this age to be attractive, if you have only found one or two girls that age to be attractive it must be because you have only seen one or two girls that age. For three, you are crazy if you think that 14 or especially 15 year old girls are just so weak and vulnerable to predators coming and taking advantage of them, but 18 year old girls man they sure have their shit together. Your opinion of young teenage girls appears to be that they are fucking retards and barely different from young children. Your opinion of photographs has no connection with reality what-so-ever and sounds like something that should get you sent to the insane asylum. Quote from: Errl_Kushman on August 31, 2013, 01:13 amNo way I'm reading all 350 of these posts BUT... OP clearly doesn't have any kids. If you ever leave the fantasy anarchy world you live in and have children, you'll get it. Also, for the record, most viewers of jews getting gassed dont plan to get off to the photos. I don't need any research to tell me most CP viewers are getting off. Thats the difference, its intangible but makes all the difference.So you admit you are the thought police, not the action police. If a Nazi looks at a picture of the holocaust and gets off on it, you think it is bad, but if some normal person looks at it and is disgusted then it is not bad. The intent of the action is what matters to you, not the action. So I am sure you think the FBI should be able to look at CP because their intent is to bust child pornographers. Do you think the FBI should be able to rape a young girl if their goal is to bust child pornographers? What if an FBI agent infiltrates a lower level rung of a production studio, and they want him to rape little girls, and eventually he can move up the ranks of the organization and topple it if he rapes enough little girls to earn their trust. Should he be allowed then to rape little girls as his intention is to topple the pedophile organization? No? But he should be able to look at pictures of CP if his intent is to arrest pedophiles correct? Yes? But I thought that looking at pictures of CP causes horrible damage to the children depicted, I thought that it leads to more children being molested even! So why are you okay with one of these things but not the other? Why are you so logically inconsistent? Are you a retard or are you a liar? \n",

OP clearly doesn't have any kids. If you ever leave the fantasy anarchy world you live in and have children, you'll get it. Also, for the record, most viewers of jews getting gassed dont plan to get off to the photos. I don't need any research to tell me most CP viewers are getting off. Thats the difference, its intangible but makes all the difference.So you admit you are the thought police, not the action police. If a Nazi looks at a picture of the holocaust and gets off on it, you think it is bad, but if some normal person looks at it and is disgusted then it is not bad.

So why are you okay with one of these things but not the other? Why are you so logically inconsistent? Are you a retard or are you a liar?I usually agree with you but, this time, you're just talking wacky!I get where you're coming from though, I really do. I believe the research may even prove you're right to some degree. However, as I said before, you clearly don't have kids. Once you have kids, shit changes. That happens,  we'll talk. Until then, stick to security and other general anarchy conversations :-)You never answered my question though, and this applies to mary666 as well: if looking at CP is the same as abusing kids, why are you okay with the police looking at CP to bust pedophiles but not okay with the police molesting kids to bust pedophiles? Is it because you know the police looking at CP obviously doesn't hurt anybody, but the police molesting kids would obviously hurt somebody? Doesn't this mean that looking at CP is not the same as molesting kids? So then what can it be that differentiates looking at pictures from molesting kids? You cannot argue intent because the police would have the same intent distributing CP to bust people who look at CP as they would have in molesting kids to bust people molesting kids. The difference is that looking at CP is a victimless crime. So why are you against people looking at CP then? Well I already gave my summary of possible reasons:A. You are a bigot and hate pedophiles for no legitimate reasonB. You have been whipped up into pedophile hysteria by the mediaC. You profit in some way from the war on CP viewersD. You are okay with eliminating entire groups of people who do not cause harm to others, in order to eliminate a small section of the targeted group that does cause harm to othersSo which one is it? If it is A you are no better than a homophobe, if it is B you have been brainwashed, if it is C you are a slave trader and if it is D then you are a very dangerous person and I wonder which group you are going to target next. Are you going to target men to bust rapists? Are you going to target drug users to bust criminals?

      "\t\t\t\tHey look, here is a famous legal picture (in USA and most of the world anyway) of child abuse, of a naked child, that is far worse than at least most of the jailbait shit people would get sent to prison for. This girl did not consent to have her picture taken nor did she consent to have her village bombed by the United States. So if somebody looks at this and it arouses them should they be put down for having looked at the image? Did their looking at the image cause the girl to be napalmed all over again? Did their demand for pictures of children being abused, which led them to this picture, cause more villages to have bombs dropped on them? Or is the current viewing of this picture independent of the Vietnam war, in that it has no effect on either the war or the girl depicted in the picture?http://static.ibnlive.in.com/ibnlive/pix/sitepix/06_2012/napalm_vietnam_picture.jpgOnly the most hardcore child pornography depicts events worse than this one, or naked children being subjected to greater abuse than being burned with napalm. So why is it legal for a sadistic pedophile to jack off to this picture, but illegal if I look at a self produced picture of some 15 year old girl flashing a mirror? \n",

      "Quote from: kmfkewm on September 01, 2013, 01:04 amI am pretty sure that there is actually no difference between a picture of one thing or of another.Actually I would like to add on to this. You say that the difference between the picture of the naked vietnamese girl burning from napalm is different from a picture of a naked 15 year old flashing her mirror because people view the vietnamese girl picture as an event but view the naked 15 year old as an object (instead of the event of a 15 year old girl flashing her mirror I suppose). So this really boils down to intent. Do you think it should be illegal for somebody to view the image of the vietnamese girl if they view her as an object for sexual gratification? Because I am sure there are some people out there who would be sexually aroused by that photograph. But I have already proven that you cannot really have intent as your differentiation factor! Because you are okay with the police looking at CP because their intent is to bust pedophiles who look at CP, but you would not be okay with the police molesting children if their intent was to bust child molesters. So you cannot really say that it is the intent of looking at an image, or how a person perceives an image, that causes the act of looking at the image to be bad. In my mind looking at an image is looking at an image and molesting a child is molesting a child, it makes no difference if a person looks at an image with the intent of helping children or if a person molests a child with the intent of helping children. It is the action that matters, not the intent, and I imagine you must agree with this if you agree that the police should not be allowed to molest children to prevent child molestation. \n",

That could be.. but it seems that Atkins and Shields came through it well.  I think because how well it was handled.  They can view it and see the innocence of it all in its context.Ah Brooke Shields, there are some images of her that are more or less identical to softcore CP images from Eastern Europe, but her images have been declared as legal and art! Just like the vietnamese girl burning from napalm is legal but a picture of some random girl burned by a pedophile is illegal.

Even though you cannot reliably tell if someone is 14.5 or 18 years old by looking at them? Even though nearly all men have the same sexual response to 14.5 year olds as they do to 18 year olds? What exactly is so cold about that? It is similar to how it is legal to fuck 16 year olds all day in the UK but as soon as you look at a picture of a 16 year old flashing you are a horrible pedophile and should be burned at the stake!

Moral relativists think slavery was moral before it was made illegal.  I don't see how you can possibly think it is okay to label someone as a child predator and lock them up for decades if they do action X in geographic region A but not if they do X in geographic region B. To me, you are mentally defective, to a far worse degree than most pedophiles are. You have been infected with statism, the worst disease known to humanity (other than possibly religion).

Yes, they have a fucking mental problem, either they want to enslave others or they have been brainwashed by the media and the government, just like with CP viewers. You don't in your community try to convince people that drugs should be legal? You don't use logical arguments to show them why they are wrong in thinking drugs should be illegal? You act like you just bow to the community and are the slave of the community but yet you use drugs? You are totally inconsistent and honestly I think you have a broken mind.

I only said it is not wrong and it should not be illegal. You think it is wrong because it is illegal. You think the law determines what is right and what is wrong, yet you are a hypocrite as you use drugs while it is not legal for you to. How about you not throw stones living in a glass house?

I'm with you on this. There's a lot more to attraction that the physical looks.Yeah, a 15 year old can look attractive, but talk to her and you'll see she is still not much more than a young child.\"Has a pretty face, breasts and pubic hair\" does not equal \"is attractive\", in my opinion.This thread is about CP though, so we are talking mainly about physical looks rather than emotional maturity. But to me, I can't separate the two. Why look at a picture of a 15 year old when you can look at a picture of a 27 year old instead?Honestly I don't care much about the personality of the adult females in the porn I look at, and I have never once talked to any of them. For me attraction is 80% visual, and I think teenagers and young twenty year olds are more visually appealing. Especially when it comes to porn, that is 100% visual attraction there is nothing else to even take into consideration. The emotional maturity of a girl is not encoded into pictures taken of her, just the way light reflects off of her. I am only being a little sarcastic when I say that I think some people must think Harry Potter is real and living creatures exist in photographs. Sure when it comes to having real relationships with people there is more to take into account, although visual attraction is still a huge role. For short term sexual relationship visual attraction is pretty close to as much the deciding factor as it is in porn. For long term relationship personality and other factors come into play a lot more. But in the context of porn the argument doesn't make much sense to me, because you don't talk to pictures you just enjoy them. In the context of relationship that is meaningful or even short term it comes into play because you seem to think that 14 and 15 year olds are not mentally developed despite being physically developed. I just don't know that I can agree that they are not mentally developed enough, I think even the medical community says that on average a 15 year old is capable of consenting and will not defer to authority. In the case of a 14 year old it might be more risky that they are taken advantage of, but I think 14 is pretty much the borderline from both physical and mental perspective. Younger than that is not likely to be physically mature enough to be more than starting to develop sexually attractive characteristics (and much younger is not gonna have such characteristics at all), and younger than that is not likely to be mature enough to consent. But I think that is a good argument for the age of consent being 14 instead of 18, perhaps with some restrictions for 14-15 like they are off limits to authority figures and can retroactively revoke consent for a period of time. That is the law in Germany and I think it makes more sense, it is a better balance between protecting children and not demonizing normal men who are not even victimizing children in many cases. 18 = can consent to sex with anyone, cannot retrospectively revoke 16 = can consent to sex except with authority figures, cannot revoke previously given consent in the future (I thought they could have sex with people in authority positions as well but I was mistaken. So Germany actually has four age categories: can consent to anyone, can consent to people not in authority positions, can consent to people not in authority positions but can revoke consent retrospectively, cannot consent).14 = can consent to sex except with authority figures such as teachers or police, can revoke consent in the future and argue that they were taken advantage of and manipulated due to their age13 = cannot consent at allGerman Law on consent:Quote2) Where sex occurs between an adult (over 18 or 21) and young persons between14 and 16, prosecution depends on the following circumstances (Sexual abuse ofyoung persons Art.182):For a person over 18 years (young adult and adult) sex with young persons between14 and 16 is forbidden if accompanied by money or gifts of value, or if the adult takesadvantage of the distressed situation of the young person (eg. homelessness) in orderto procure sex. (An exception *may* be granted if the young person is a prostitute.In addition to this, it is forbidden for a person over 21 years (adult) to perform anysexual act with a person under 16, if the young person is not capable of sexualself-determination; (This determination can only be made after the 'victim' has beengiven a psychological examination). This last regulation is pursued only on complaint ofthe victim's parents or foster-parents, except for cases of public interest.The legal age of consent for dependent relationships, (e.g., teacher/student etc) is18 (Sexual abuse of dependants Art. 174).and it looks like they also break CP into three categories as well13 and under = child porn , illegal, strictly prosecuted14-17 = youth porn, legally ambiguous, tolerated18+ = legalI think the following quote shows a funny absurdness to their law though:QuoteGiving access and showing pornography to persons under 18 is forbidden. It is, forinstance, legal for a man or woman to have consensual sex with a 16-year-old, and tovideo or film this activity, but it is not legal to show this film to the young personconcerned or to any other person under 18.  Although it is no worse than the USA, where it is legal to look directly at the breasts of a 16 year old in some states but illegal to look at a photograph of them. It actually looks like it is legal to produce porn of 14 year olds for commercial distribution in Germany, provided they have their parents permission, pass a psychological evaluation and are not financially compensated for it. So really even the claim that CP is legal in 50% of the world is an understatement, in many European countries it seems they allow porn of 14-17 year olds to be viewed and even produced. \n",

      "Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on August 17, 2013, 06:48 amok, we're just finishing up some of these changes and starting to push the data out to the pages on the site.  Most of it is hidden at the moment, but you can see the layout on the vendor pages has changed.Here's where we are at:The rating algorithm has been changed to the following:A vendor's score, which determines their rank and factors into the weight of buyers, is found by adding up all of their sales with each sale multiplied by a factor that starts at 100% now and tapers off to 0% after 8 months.A buyer's score, which affects how heavily their feedback is weighted when determining a vendor's rating (not rank), is found by multiplying the price of their purchases by the vendor score of the vendor they purchased from, and then adding them all togetherA rating/review's score, which determines it's weight when averaging with other ratings, is found by multiplying the buyer weight of the buyer leaving the rating, the volume of the purchase, and the same dampening factor used for the vendor's score.We also have a graphic that will appear on vendor pages and when browsing listings that shows the relative weight of the ratings 1 through 5.  I've looked at many of these for different vendors and I think it is much more informative than the simple average we have now and will take the pressure off of buyers to leave only a 5 or a 1.  This is hidden at the moment.on deck:The average rating (number in parentheses after a vendor's name) is still being calculated the old way.  We need to compare the new to the old before updating and make sure there aren't any major discrepancies.  Once this is done, we'll switch to the new system and display the rating graphic.next, we'll remove the \"leave feedback\" box from the orders page and leave just the 1 - 5 rating, and add a link to the vendor pages that shows up when you've ordered from them that you can click on and leave a review.then, we'll give the option to sort reviews by most recent or by review weight and display the buyer's stats next to the review (total spent, total transaction, number of vendors bought from, and maybe buyer weight)There is one last thing on deck, but I'm going to leave it as a surprise ;)Awesome news DPR, you are as always the best, have a great weekend!\n",

If the feedback algorithm wasn't so complex (math geek level complex) these things would be easier to figure out. Someone mentioned in either this or another thread the idea of simplifying the feedback system and going the eBay route of positive, neutral, negative along with a comment. It's not a bad idea. During my days as a buyer, I never left less than a 5/5 mostly because I couldn't figure out exactly what constitutes a 4/5 or 3/5 or even a 2/5. I wasn't even worried about being blacklisted since it never occurred to me back then that you could be. The only thing I knew was, I got my order usually hassle free and it came in decent enough time. So 5/5. Some vendors gave a little \"street\" attitude on occasion but I didn't think it was anything to dock a point for. Had been in resolutions a couple of times and everything worked out in the end. I got shorted a time or two, but I contacted the vendors and they were cool about it and made it up to me. Saying all that to say, not having had experienced a situation that warranted less than 5/5, IMO, and that didn't deserve a 1/5, the ratings in between don't seem to have much practical or sensible use. It's hard to quantify using numbers how you might \"feel\" about a transaction. Words like \"positive,\" \"neutral,\" and \"negative\" seem to better convey how someone might feel about the total transaction experience. The numbers from 1 to 5 I guess could be quantified like a survey's fill in the bubble thing. Such as:5 = positive4 = less than positive, but not neutral3 = neutral2 = less than neutral, but not negative1 = negative. Yeah, looking at it, that doesn't make sense especially considering that a 4/5 can have as much impact on a vendor's rating as a 1/5 does depending on who's leaving it and how much the order was for. Probably need to do away with the number system and move to the 3 word rating system.As miss Bliss would say... that's my 2 Satoshi. \n",

      "Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 amQuote from: BenJesuit on August 21, 2013, 01:08 amQuote from: Cork1Screw on August 20, 2013, 10:58 pmI'm not at all comfortable with the various ebay-SR comparison arguments. On ebay, it takes nothing to become a seller. It makes sense to me that they would have to protect buyers more in that situation. It's really just apples and oranges if you ask me, I don't think ebay's success and silk road's will be because of the same reasons at all. Just way too many variables there.I personally don't think having buyer feedback would be any worse the current atmosphere of \"Leave 5/5 or I'm putting your name on the blacklist!\" that seems to be the entrenched attitude in the system.You make a good argument and I have to agree. You're right, you can't compare eBay to SR. But it seems that is the way the powers that be are trying to make it seem like. The potential negatives of the new discussion will probably prove to outweigh the positives intended. The fact that it is anonymous on top of the anonymity the site provides is a recipe for trouble. Though it seems that posters can be banned from being able to post in discussions if they violate the arbitrary \"be polite, not inflammatory\" rule. And of course, anything that a vendor feels is negative can be construed as inflammatory. And in most cases, the vendor would probably be right. But will SR admins agree? A few people opined that the discussion system is redundant to the feedback system and forum. When you think about it, they are probably correct. If feedback can be abused, so can the discussion system. But on the plus side, vendor ratings next to vendor name are back! So what's the score? Buyers 12, vendors 0? :pQuote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 amThe discussion system does seem redundant. And also less reliable than feedback. If anyone who has not actually used that vendor can leave a discussion, how am I supposed to trust that? Especially if I can make 12 accounts randomly and just start discussing vendors in a negative, but not inflammatory way as to incite a mod to delete my posts. Unless mods will just delete any negative post that gets reported.Buyers too need a lot of time to be able to change reviews. Not all of us can receive LSD on a Wednesday and take a whole bunch immediately.  Personally, I think I leave good, informational reviews on the products I buy, even if I have to fill in the details in a month. If I don't try something right away, but it measures out right, came on time and all looks right... I'll give the vendor the benefit of the doubt and leave a 5 for now. Come back and comment on the quality (always has been good) later.Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 amI also don't get how buyer feedback would be a better measure than stats? Maybe we should add reships as a buyer stat, like we have refund rate. But knowing that I have 16 successful transactions on my account and no refunds should show I'm legit.I think refunds/reships is no doubt an important buyer stat that should be shared. If you have 16 decent sized transactions and no reships or refunds you certainly look legit.Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 am If I have 16 transactions and a bad comment, because I gave a vendor a 4/5 for shipping a week late, now I look worse and the system isn't as effective. Well, I guess I partially agree with this. I think if you have 16 transactions and one vendor was a little upset it might be fair to say you \"look worse,\" but I don't think that means the system isn't as effective. As soon as DPR changed the rating system from (100) to being x/5, my rating went down significantly. I was (100) in the previous system, now I'm (4.8) in this system. Do I look worse? Yes. Does that mean the system is necessarily less effective? No. Your next points highlight the real problem I think.Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 amThe real problem with the current feedback system is that its unacceptable to give a vendor anything below a 5 on a review. That is what taints the system. Its not honest and open. I think this is indeed a big problem with the current system. It started with the very unfortunate choice of words they picked - \"Negative\" and \"Positive.\" If anything less than 5/5 is counted as \"NEGATIVE\" feedback, it only makes sense that a system would evolve that really pressured people to only leave 5/5. If a C-grade experience warrants a 5/5, but an A-grade experience also only warrants a 5/5, and I have to have an F-grade experience to warrant anything else, the system is definitely broken.Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 amAny improvement should just be geared to make it so that if a vendor gets a single 1/5 it does not blow up their entire score. That way, if some buyer threatened to change their feedback a month later, it wouldn't be such a massive fucking deal if they did. One 1/5 out of 500 transactions can be seen as an outlier to any intelligent buyer. Unless it brings down a sells ranking so drastically.... That system just doesn't make senseAgain I agree. As it is right now, I have no idea how they calculate how much a 4/5 brings you down, but it is a LOT!!! From my rough math, I will need about a hundred 5/5s of the same value to \"get rid of\" the negative effects of a 4/5. Vendor JacknHoff had a similar issue where a couple stray feedback among hundreds have brought him down to like 4.0/5. Is the actual AVERAGE of his feedback 4/5? Hell no, but some weird mathematical formula that gives WAY too much weight to \"negative feedback,\" makes him look like a shitty vendor. While this is still the case, it only makes sense that vendors will still be heavily encouraging leaving 5/5 feedback. I can tell you right now if I get a 4/5 feedback from someone in the current system they will have to be at the very least personally blacklisted.Quote from: heatcheck on August 21, 2013, 04:15 amUntil the feedback system exists so that I don't have to give out a 5. It is broken. When I can give a 3/5 because the vendor sold me okay weed, packaged in something not so stealthy that stank, and came a week late, the system is broken. Right now I would have to give that person a 5 and just type that stuff out.I agree. I think you're on the right track. I honestly think the answer is two fold: One, Buyer Feedback. Vendors need to be able to see this. Two, \"negative feedback\" (anything less than 5/5) should not count so heavily!Personally, I think if I have 99 5/5 reviews and one 3/5 review my average should be 4.98/5!!! That just makes simple mathematical sense. As it stands right now your average would be more likely to be way lower depending on a slew of variables no one really understands and is ultimately terrified of. If 99 5/5 reviews and one 3/5 review can drop my rating by 0.20 instead of by 0.02, I think there is a problem. The only real argument I can see for not making negative feedback have less impact is that \"oh well but then scamming vendors wont be as easy to pick out early.\" And I think that's pretty much a non-point. AFAIK the vast majority of scamming vendors have near perfect feedback when they run their scam anyway - see Planet Express for example.\n",

A 4 rating is much more honest on the whole than a vendor who has a perfect 5 record, particularly since many vendors have made it clear that anything less than 5 will incur penalties - from vendor blacklisting to them telling other vendors to blacklist. Which means a 5 is tainted.I don't particularly want to get into an argument here as ratings seem to be a major sticking point between buyers and sellers and this latest round of changes doesn't seem to have made ratings any more useful to buyers but I will point out that you do not \"deserve\" any rating - you *earn* your rating and feedback through the quality of the sale process and the goods.The attitude that buyers should be grateful that they got their drugs (or their money back) and should give top marks because of it, no matter what the quality of the service, shipping and drugs themselves, is not helpful to anyone.\n",

I bet you would also, even if you don't realize it yet.Not necessarily. The pressure on buyers to give 5/5 is so great that it detracts from its value.When I look at reviews, I am less interested in the 5/5 ratings than knowing the likely worst case scenario. I want to see what happened when something went wrong, and how the vendor handled it. For example, if vendors get 3/5 or 4/5 because the product took longer than expected, then if I am not in a hurry it's not a problem for me. Again, if a lower rating is given just because that product is not exactly as described (eg colour or crystal size), this is unlikely to affect my decision as to whether to buy. With the new feedback system it is the discussion feature which I turn to first, and then the forum posts.I don't expect vendors to be perfect, but neither do I expect buyers' ratings and reviews to be 100% accurate.Since the new feedback system came in I have not given any ratings yet because it is not possible for me to relay feedback on product quality for a month or so. (Note the word \"relay\".) Fortunately the discussion feature does allow me to comment on delivery stealth and packaging. For the record all the ratings I have given have been 5/5, and I am grateful for the excellent service my SR vendors have provided. However faced with an option to leave 5/5 or else be banned from using that  vendor again, I would buy from another vendor or do without.\n",

With an MBE mail box you use our street address so private carrier (UPS®, FedEx®, DHL®, Toll, Australian Air express etc.) deliveries are no problem… someone is always in the office at MBE! Mail and packages from any country can be received and forwarded, and customers can be notified of the arrival of an item. Location is everything. And convenient locations are just one reason that people come to Mail Boxes Etc. for mailbox services.Our mail boxes offer you a real street address, not just a P.O. Box. By giving your business mail a location, you’ll gain your clients’ confidence.Mail box rates vary by location, service level and length of commitment — the longer you rent the better the value MODIFICATIONS TO BASE TEMPLATE_____________________________-----------------------------------------------MOD #001: keys---------------------Rather than use physical keys, the box relies on authentication via proof of access to private key. Sending from a Bitcoin address proves that you have admin access to the private key of that address. A transfer of BTC0.00022 to a specified address (pre-associated with a particular locker) unlocks it (or initiates another command function). Mod #002: no humans-----------------------------With no physical keys, no humans are needed to administer the boxes - akin to public lockers at train -stations except with the addition of an addressing number like a PO Box. Mod #003: custom timeframes--------------------------------------By transferring BTC to address for that locker, additional time can be booked/ paid-ahead. Boxes could be used like lockers (to store shopping or a handbag) and/or could be used as a permanent delivery address or a temporary needs-based one.Mod #004: filtering deliveries-------------------------------------Want to filter deliveries? Simply engage the setting such that deliveries must be authenticated via providing the public key associated with the owner (ie. current renter) of the box Mod #005: transferrable ownership---------------------------------------------Transfer the private key, transfer the rights. NB: system to liquidate current balance of rent paid ahead back to the receiving wallet and then time delay to move this to another address and reestablish ownership would be necessary (and not very complex).  When humans are removed, so is the need to personally administer setup. Box vacancy rates published publicly online and boxes booked & securing at same time via payment.Non-Mod #A: no physical contact required------------------------------------------------------Add-in existing mail-forwarding functionality (either human or robot administered) .

      "Quote from: AussieDomesticDrugs on August 26, 2013, 04:19 pmI love the new system, the more information buyers have the better, but at the same time it's good that our total sales volume is now obscured from LE, making it harder for them to deduce the scope of our dealings in any possible legal action.I can't wait for the new updates where you will add more options to protect against scamming buyers. Please allow vendors to rate buyers, this would cut down on so much scamming and also give a chance for really good buyers to be rewarded with a reputation that would make their future transactions with other vendors easier. Not only that, it would give the staff in resolution center more information to work with as they could more carefully review a buyers history as a customer!Keep up the good work DPR, we really appreciate what you are doing :)IMO buyers have less information now that the review button is tucked away on the vendor page and buyers have to click through to it in order to write a feedback or review which was previously just grouped with the 1-5 rating after finalizing.  To me it discourages the feedback/review write ups and while that may help vendors in terms of protecting the size of their business it doesn't help buyers make informed decisions about who to do business with.  Buyers are already under enough pressure to rate vendors 5/5 even if not 100% satisfied because first and foremost the vendor has the buyers address at that point.  And then on top of that a lot of vendors state anything less than 5/5 will result in black listing or banning from future purchases.  So what good is the 1-5 rating system anyways if buyers are going to be strong armed into rating a 5/5?  I don't see a need for vendors to rate buyers.  Buyers have much less to do than vendors.  We place the orders and send encrypted address information and then wait until product comes and then finalize.  That's it.  So what exactly would you be reviewing the buyers for?  It would probably just come down to finalizing.  That's what the vendors are in it for is the money.  So buyer reviews would say maybe something like  \"Buyer finalizes on time.\" \"Buyer went to resolution tread lightly.\"  Is it really necessary?\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThis comment is not meant to be discouraging, but rather to be a caution of the most glaring potential complication: Given the difference in volume of transactions of one vendor vs. that of one buyer, a bad review would be of a lot higher consequence to the buyer. The reason for buyer feedback, empowering vendors, can very easily turn into a power trip for vendors. There is currently a lot higher a threshold of scam accusations afforded to vendors than there is to buyers, and for good reason- they pay a bond, they cut their teeth in a tough opening game, and deal with a lot more people, instead of whipping together an account willy-nilly like a buyer can. I think that this already protects them in a way that is not a slippery slope away from blackmail and extortion. The \"buyer black lists\", though opaque, are at least available as suggestions to be discussed between vendors. Buyer reviews would serve as permanent marks that are not up for discussions of evidence. So, if this was done, there would need to be some very good assurance that false accusations and hasty incriminations would have as little consequence as they do when they are placed against vendors.\n",

At this rate I'd create a second \"don't give a fuck\" account to buy from smaller Vendors, or simply not risk ordering from them and concentrate my BTCs on the EMPIRE BUSINESS Vendors such as Technohippy.Which would be a shame because I'm actively trying to spread my purchases over many Vendors in appreciation of the range of them.TL;DR - I can understand the motivation behind this proposal but it has NOT been thought through.I feel the same way, which is why I think that buyer's/vendor's should not be able to see the other's rating until after they have both left ratings which are permanent. This will remove the fear of receiving a bad rep from a buyer/vendor because of honest feedback given.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tI'd like to thank everyone but especially terpene and Rocknessie for raising some very valid points that concern me. Fortunately as a vendor I don't think I get scammed too much, I'm not sure why but I've had a great run of luck lately and have had no problems other than late finalising because of Tor downtime I suspect.terpene made the very valid point that as soon as a buyer gets 'negged' buy a vendor they can set up another account. Personally I think the worst solution would be to blacklist areas or regions, it would be ineffective and would potentially punish innocent people.Rocknessie also made a very valid point that people will be more inclined to 5/5 to get a 5/5 back, the problem is that hiding the feedback until both parties have left it is if the buyer wants to leave a 1/5 and you are happy to try and resolve it then the deed is done and you will never know until you have given them positive feedback potentially(I believe Whiteshark also sort of raised this)Personally I think a buyer bond may be potentially worth working in. I paid $500 to be here, I got it back by proving myself so a nominal amount like 0.001BTC or an initial deposit that must be spent on SR perhaps of say 0.5BTC to create some sort of personal investment. Perhaps there could be 'bonded' buyers who could be denoted somehow, I know none of these are ideal but I'm trying to think of ways of making it easier for new buyers to get started and harder for sock puppeteering.One of the main problems I have currently is that with the SR downtime/Tor botnet attacks people can't finalise, perhaps as has been suggested a 7 day auto-finalise period that doesn't penalise buyer stats could be offered in the delivery options? For example when I set the domestic delivery price there is a dropdown menu that gives you a couple of options(7 days, 17 days) but with no punishment for A-F on the 7 days since it can be due to downtime, legitimate personal stuff, etc. This also leaves the option of paying slightly extra for 17 days to finalise should the customer desire, for an extra few £/$ I wouldn't mind as much when people finalise late.There are no perfect solutions but I think a vendor being able to put notes on a buyer of some kind to inform other vendors of any situation that may have occurred. For example if a person has a re-send you don't want to punish the people who legitimately deserve it but if I could pop a note on a page for other vendors with their buyer stats just saying something like 'all seemed legit but did need resend, otherwise fine.' that would be enough for other vendors to be wary of re-sends to that individual and the resolution center would be aware of it in future. I'm not a big fan of 'blacklists' and geo-bans and I don't want to see the innocent punished, personally I think simply being able to leave some kind of text with notes would be enough and would avoid blackmailing, etc.I really don't envy the position DPR is in, trying to run a self-policing system based around anonymity is no small task. So far I must say that my first 6 months here have been the most rewarding and fulfilling of my life, thank you for providing me with that opportunity. I'm sure whatever we end up with we will figure out ways of making it work in a reasonable manner.Again thanks to everyone who has been posting informed responses in this thread, it has got me thinking.Jah BlessThe Doctor\n",

      "Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on September 18, 2013, 10:32 pmPeople die from ecstasy because of overdose and low purity. These people don't know what they are taking and how much, but it's the best they can do because of all the damage prohibition has done to the market for drugs.This point can't be made enough times. Back when alcohol was illegal countless people died each year due to alcohol poisoning. These numbers pleased the progressive fucks who pushed for it to be outlawed in the first place. Fact is that most of these poisonings were NOT due to the alcohol itself but due to its cutting agents like formaldehyde and other yummy chemicals. You can look at the numbers today and feel very confident that so many people who OD aren't legitimately dying from taking the drugs in question but from outright dangerous cutting agents, not knowing what is being consumed (like thinking it's oxy when it's really fentanyl) and having no idea about the purity. An orderly marketplace like SR cuts down on this kind of bullshit dramatically. Anyone who tries to get around it selling polluted or diluted product usually gets found out almost immediately.QuoteGrowth has been phenomenal without a single dollar spent on advertising. You don't get that kind of result by being a control freak. You get it by holding yourself and others to a sane and liberating credo: That an action is moral in all cases except when it initiates the use of force or fraud. If that last sentence went over your head, read it again until you get its implications.Fucking A!QuoteWhat I AM against is the agents of the state being involved at all. If they had simply left people to their own devices and allowed them the freedom to choose as I have at Silk Road, we'd have an economy so productive and robust it would be generating wealth for centuries to come, with more than enough for everyone. Instead we have giant war machines, surveillance states that are looking more and more like prisons, debt that won't be paid off for centuries if ever, oppression, strife, and hunger in varying degrees all over the worldI think I REALLY need to start reading some of your other stuff because this is textbook libertarian thinking. Exactly what I believe in and I couldn't be happier that someone like you with this kind of true understanding of the marketplace and human existence is running the show here.QuoteHumanity is at a critical juncture. Either violence will dominate the future of mankind, or peace will. The way of the sate is the way of violence, oppression and death. The way of the market is freedom, dignity and peace. If you understand this, it is your moral duty to protect the victims of the state in any way you can.I couldn't agree with you more. Seeing as we've chosen a record amount of death over the past century (over 100 million killed in wars and nearly another 100 million people killed by just the two largest communist states) I'd like to think that we'll choose peace this time around. We just need a real economic collapse before that'll happen. At that point people will either cry for MORE government. Or less. A lot less is what I'm betting. Libertarian thinking is being seeded all over the world and its roots have already taken hold. Large vines intertwining their ways throughout societies worldwide will make their way everywhere. It's only a matter of time. The only question is, do people start cutting them down or water them for a long time to come?QuoteIf anything I was even more loving, empathetic, creative, bold, thoughtful, etc. than when sober.We can't have that now can we!!!  ;)QuoteOf course legalization would be a tremendous win for drug users and freedom lovers and you'd have to be a cruel, cold person to still support the drug war at this point. Maybe when it got started you could plead ignorance, but now it's plain to see it has completely failed to meet its stated objectives and done immeasurable damage.It's meanness and cruelty. I guess some of the War on Drugs supporters are well meaning but hypocritical thugs with ZERO understanding of the utter fucking embarrassment that their cherished war has become. Useful idiots.QuoteHow many people have starved to death because the agents of the state use up all of the resources to fight endless wars, subsidize invasive and destructive projects and do their best to keep everyone else under their thumbs? There is nothing redeeming there. The little good they do eek out is just enough to get elected and avoid revolt. The damage they do is so immense most don't even see it, like water to the fish. I only hope enough of us wake up to this reality before it is too late to do anything about it.\"The bigger the lie, the more people who will believe it.\"QuoteIn short, Silk Road is an example of a moral culture where peace, cooperation and ethical competition are the norm, and violence and fraud are found only on the margin. This is opposed to the nation states of the world, where violence and fraud are used as a means to control their citizenry and to dominate one another. The people that make up human society at large need to adopt the Silk Road credo or we may all perish, or live under the thumbs of tyrants indefinitely.Right on! Freedom from coercion. Freedom to choose. Freedom to think for yourself. Freedom to produce, trade and create. Freedom to live peacefully without government goons breathing down your neck or shoving a gun or taser in your face. Responsibility for your own actions. Caring for yourself and your friends and family instead of FORCING other people to take care of you instead. The belief in the supremacy of the individual not the collective or the state. The belief that you can't run society based on the lowest common denominator of chaos, violence and terror. And that people aren't inherently evil and made good by laws backed by the monopoly of violence of the state. SR proves that every single day that it operates. Thank you for that DPR.\n",

      "Quote from: Dread Pirate Roberts on September 18, 2013, 10:32 pmI was asked a couple of questions privately the other day and wound up going on a bit of a rant in response.  Thought it would make a good forum post:I agree with you completely DPR.I personally do wonder if drugs should be entirely uncontrolled.  That is, being sold in supermarkets. I'm thinking the best situation is probably one where only the pharmacist can sell drugs, but they sell it to everyone upon request. No prescriptions, nobody who can tell you that can't have something. But the pharmacist could advise you on dosage, drug interaction and any dangers for an individual (e.g. someone who already has high blood pressure shouldn't take certain drugs).At the same time I think alcohol, nicotine and caffeine should not be sold in supermarkets. (probably apart from chocolate since the dose is incredibly low) That way people would have to make the concious choice to walk into a liquor store and not be confronted with drugs every day while shopping for groceries. And people should become aware that alcohol and caffeine are also drugs. Seriously, 90% or so of all adults in the west using both an upper and a downer, often on a daily basis? But worst of all, they honestly believe they are not doing drugs because according to the law, these substances are not categorized as drugs.I've been thinking for a while that someone should buy some caffeine powder, offer random people in public a cup of coffee and snort some caffeine themselves.. I actually doubt anyone would be able to realize that the snorter took the exact same thing as the person who just had a cup of coffee.. In fact whoever did this would probably get arrested, but it would make a great YouTube video.On the other hand, maybe absolutely everything should be sold in supermarkets. And anyone who manages to kill themselves with high quality drugs, well, blame Darwin.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tThe people who drafted and signed the declaration of independence 237 years ago today were standing up to tyrants just as we are.  I'm proud to carry on their legacy.  Here are their words, many of which ring true still today:---When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these ColoniesFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n",

      "Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amYep he's got you there!Anyway;My thoughts on slavery are that if you sell your self into slavery you are not a slave; you have merely entered into a rather onerous employment contract. You cannot include your future offspring in the deal as children are not property.Enslaving by force I would have thought is not permitted even by the most extravagant libertarian.       I have continued reading this book ( skipping over his constant crude mischaracterisations of socialism) with interest. I must admit to difficulty in understanding why the author is so idealogically committed to the market as the absolute and only judge of human endevour. To me, the market is a natural force; an extremely complex system of counterbalancing forces that has a tendency to self regulate. But to claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.     An analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.        The market was made for man. It should not be master.        Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\". But we are not talking about teenagers earning spending money here. Child labour regulations were brought in after the industrial revolution, when unbridled capitalism amongst the factories and mills of northern England had driven wages for the \"hands\" below subsistence level. The children of these working families \"wanted\" the \"freedom\" to work, as the alternative was hunger. This to me seems a poor kind of freedom.          You all seem to agree that to force a child to work against his will was wrong. But what if the economic system you have established leaves a child with this kind of choice? Where is the freedom for this child? Work or starve?        Sadly there are many children in the world today faced with this choice. But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.         I feel about the market a similar way that I feel about government: when it ceases to serve our purpose we may freely discard it in favor of a better system.         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations. In many industries there are 3-4 main  players offering roughly the same range of products for the same price, and this tends to lessen the benefits of competition for the consumer. And even when the customer benefits, the suppliers don't.       Large companies suffer many of the same faults as large governments: a tendency to seek nothing but a continuation of their own power. We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force. With all due respect, that's kind of the problem with private police forces! I have difficulty seeing how such a system could work peacefully to resolve disputes.       If I assault my neighbor, who's police force deals with the complaint? His or mine? Or do we both have the same one, being neighbors.       If I am paying a private force, do they take my side automatically. Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.       Some good points ghost, and thanks for not taking offense when the author criticizes your views.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amAn analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.This gave me pause, because I can see your point.  I think I see where your analogy breaks down though.  There are no competing interests within your self.  You are a unit, an indivisible will or being.  The choices you make to achieve your ends are yours alone.  If your body is ailing and you take medicine, the outcome is your responsibility.  Human civilization on the other hand is made up of many beings, each with their own interests.  What one perceives as good, another may perceive as bad.  Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amThe market was made for man. It should not be master.As described in section 2 of the reading, the market is not yet another policy prescription enforced by government, it is the absence of such force.  It is the absence of one party imposing their view of good and bad on another.  So, the market is not made, it emerges from the multitude of voluntary interactions between individuals.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\".

Work or starve?        Sadly there are many children in the world today faced with this choice. But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.I'm not sure how we disagree here.  If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option?  If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse.  That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves.  Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities.Had they been allowed to develop freely, only under the constrains of supply, demand and property rights, they would have had to provide a safe work environment for their employees, if that's what the employees wanted.  Let me give you a quick example.  Nike and Reebok both have shoe factories in the same city.  All of their resources and external conditions are effectively identical.  The only thing they can vary is the quality of the work environment for their employees.  Nike chooses to spend $1 per man-hour maintaining an improved work environment for its employees, while Reebok keeps that dollar as profit.  Reebok will quickly find itself unable to attract the employee base it needs to produce its shoes as Nike takes its employees and market share.  So, Reebok, instead of improving the work conditions, simply passes the extra $1 per hour on to their employees.  Now we are seeing the market at work.  Employees are now faced with the option of a safe work environment, or an extra dollar per hour.  Some will choose safety while others will choose the extra pay.And this is exactly what has happened eventually, where now employers do all they can to attract good employees away from their competitors.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations.

We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.I have also noticed this tendency.  The people who run corporations, heads of state, the person selling you food, you, me and every human being are all fallible and capable of using power to dominate other people.  Liberty is not a pill that makes men angels.  What it does do is limit the extent to which evil can be expressed in the world.  Right now, in any given geographic area, we have a monopoly on many of the most vital social institutions that is maintained through violence.  If voluntary organizations consolidate their power and turn on their customers and start stealing from them, putting them in cages, killing them, spying on them and telling them what they can and can't do, well then we're back to where we started, the present day state.  But, if I am correct, and the pressure for those firms to compete with one another for our favor leads them to serve us, then we can have freedom and prosperity the likes of which the world has never known.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force.

Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.Maybe we can read this essay next, but check out Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy.  He speculates how a free market in security services might organize itself, but his most important point is that no one knows ahead of time how an industry will organize.  The security industry has been insulated from market conditions for so long and is so out of touch with the needs of its customers, that I suspect it would be unrecognizable after a transition to its optimal form.  There are ten thousand questions that we could muse about similar to the one you posed, but the point is that, if we do our best to adhere to the non-aggression principle, then we can quickly move in the right direction without having to know ahead of time exactly how the final form of such an institution would look.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.This is where the institution of private property and markets really shine.  Markets curb unsustainable growth through the price mechanism.  As a needed resource is depleted, its supply drops and, assuming constant or rising demand, its price will rise.  Rising prices force people to consume LESS of the resource and save more of it.  Private property also incentivizes people to maximize the value of it.  People tend to preserve and improve their land and capital.  Free enterprise and private property, when honored, are an environmentalists dream.  These institutions maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used to satisfy people's desires, and have natural rationing mechanisms built in to keep people from over consuming.  If we ever get into some economic theory in this club, we can talk about the concept of the evenly rotating economy, which really drives the point home how only a free society can ever have a hope at sustainability.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amto claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.I can assure you that I am not willfully ignorant.  I have a very open mind and if an argument that can stand up to reason and be shown to accurately describe reality is presented to me, then I would gladly change my mind. My views have been forged by a search for the truth that has lasted my entire adult life and continues to this day.  I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors.  Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward.  Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs?  We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to.\n",

      "\t\t\t\t\tThank you for expressing a dissenting viewpoint.  I appreciate a civilized debate, so allow me to respond.  Quote from: bitfool on September 23, 2012, 07:15 amSilk road is nice because it's a fuck-you of sorts to the powers that be......but...It will have no impact whatsoever on the so called war on drugs. It's not going to affect government in any meaningful way. Agorism is a pretty lame strategy.  It may even backfire (from the point of view of agorists) and cause the government to ban tor or bitcoin or both. Of course it can be done, just ask ISPs to do a bit of traffic shaping. Lastly, DPR is doing this for the money.Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs.  The effect of the war is to limit people's access to controlled substances.  Silk Road has expanded people's access.  The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles.  Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction.  So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no?  Personally, I don't think they can be effectively banned at this point.  Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing.On your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification.  Money is one motivating factor for me.  If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor.  Money motivates me for two reasons.  For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause.  I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant.  In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally.  I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit.  Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see.  Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here.All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference.  As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people.  It's fulfilling to me.  If you don't know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you.  There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself.  It's paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on other's, the happier you'll be.  Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish \n",

$1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.  The average response looked like this:15% of the first $1011% of $10 - $508.14% of $50 - $2505.6% of $250 - $10003.7% of $1000 - $5000We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:10% of the first $508.5% of $50 - 1506% of $150 - 3003% of $300 - 5002% of $500 - 10001.5% for everything over $1000With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.  Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.  We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.  If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)iQEbBAEBAgAGBQJPCl0BAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olWDsH9jGBcHVl302TYnOpD/oc2G9wZN1H56v/oRww3het2ESSUokjfoU3JFs5442eNvvNQohHlN3Z2gVBpm4c7BQKVBTBIlfjalIMr1bzMtjVzvwV+CJSF7KHrz91eUDICtpOgNIVQ36CxYA1c9cjHuOVVNbU6N6qVycC4TS2Oy38DUJlYm5UsLcxTqQhlLkiXuUH3uOMp7pwLfPlDmrz4nojWooqFwQ6JBFuMG5/wO0NcKgP4hXWcAmo24oGbaC6/5jUjQ7ze7ILsZf7ykeOi3O3ZhyGn2WyY5+99dc39kviJhIwQfvu8VWaDlYBgvh3PlDENIYD4ThgAzdUoW0Nha4LXA===wI/M-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----CLARIFICATION:  The new policy regarding out of escrow transactions stated in this address does not affect a vendor's ability to ask their customers to finalize their orders and release payment before shipment.  We still strongly recommend that buyers avoid doing this at all costs because we will be unable to protect you in case of fraud.CLARIFICATION:  This new policy also does not affect vendors who use the market as a platform for Bitcoin exchange.  They may continue to operate as usual, but again we strongly recommend that you purchase bitcoins through a non-anonymous vendor because the market is not set up to facilitate bitcoin exchange and your money can be stolen without recourse.FURTHER COMMENTARY: https://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion.to/index.php?topic=8539.0\n",

Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me. This change IS about scam prevention. We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams. We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization. Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along. We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff. It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change. There is lots about this organization that just isn't going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately. Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else's expense, or the expense of our stated goals. If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom. I am greedy for power. Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs. If we can get to that world, I can die happy. Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started. It could literally change the world as we know it. It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there. Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world? Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed? Why aren't you telling me to raise the commission even further then? I don't hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods. I don't hear anyone saying don't do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we're happy to do our part. As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision. Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success. In that world, Silk Road will be a shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy. Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this. We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever. I don't like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time. Silk Road NEEDS our support. It needs everything we have. The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage. HELP ME GET US THERE!!! Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind. P.S. Here's another thing that doesn't get said enough: I love you. This is the most fun I've ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life. Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs. Stand by me as we stand up for ourselves. - Silk Road admin \n",
      "You'll have to wait for my memoirs for the juicy details, lol. I've got some stories though, I'll tell ya. One weird thing that goes through my head when Silk Road goes through a growth spurt, like after the first gawker article is that sound effect from inception, or the intense music from the new tron movie. It gives me the sensation of \"holy shit, this is EPIC!\" \n",
      "Thank you for expressing a dissenting viewpoint. I appreciate a civilized debate, so allow me to respond. Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs. The effect of the war is to limit people's access to controlled substances. Silk Road has expanded people's access. The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles. Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction. So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state. The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no? Personally, I don't think they can be effectively banned at this point. Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing. On your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification. Money is one motivating factor for me. If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor. Money motivates me for two reasons. For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause. I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant. In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally. I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit. Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons. More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see. Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here. All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference. As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people. It's fulfilling to me. If you don't know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you. There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself. It's paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on other's, the happier you'll be. Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish  \n",
      "Some good points ghost, and thanks for not taking offense when the author criticizes your views. This gave me pause, because I can see your point. I think I see where your analogy breaks down though. There are no competing interests within your self. You are a unit, an indivisible will or being. The choices you make to achieve your ends are yours alone. If your body is ailing and you take medicine, the outcome is your responsibility. Human civilization on the other hand is made up of many beings, each with their own interests. What one perceives as good, another may perceive as bad. As described in section 2 of the reading, the market is not yet another policy prescription enforced by government, it is the absence of such force. It is the absence of one party imposing their view of good and bad on another. So, the market is not made, it emerges from the multitude of voluntary interactions between individuals. I'm not sure how we disagree here. If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option? If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse. That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves. Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities. Had they been allowed to develop freely, only under the constrains of supply, demand and property rights, they would have had to provide a safe work environment for their employees, if that's what the employees wanted. Let me give you a quick example. Nike and Reebok both have shoe factories in the same city. All of their resources and external conditions are effectively identical. The only thing they can vary is the quality of the work environment for their employees. Nike chooses to spend $1 per man-hour maintaining an improved work environment for its employees, while Reebok keeps that dollar as profit. Reebok will quickly find itself unable to attract the employee base it needs to produce its shoes as Nike takes its employees and market share. So, Reebok, instead of improving the work conditions, simply passes the extra $1 per hour on to their employees. Now we are seeing the market at work. Employees are now faced with the option of a safe work environment, or an extra dollar per hour. Some will choose safety while others will choose the extra pay. And this is exactly what has happened eventually, where now employers do all they can to attract good employees away from their competitors. I have also noticed this tendency. The people who run corporations, heads of state, the person selling you food, you, me and every human being are all fallible and capable of using power to dominate other people. Liberty is not a pill that makes men angels. What it does do is limit the extent to which evil can be expressed in the world. Right now, in any given geographic area, we have a monopoly on many of the most vital social institutions that is maintained through violence. If voluntary organizations consolidate their power and turn on their customers and start stealing from them, putting them in cages, killing them, spying on them and telling them what they can and can't do, well then we're back to where we started, the present day state. But, if I am correct, and the pressure for those firms to compete with one another for our favor leads them to serve us, then we can have freedom and prosperity the likes of which the world has never known. Maybe we can read this essay next, but check out Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy. He speculates how a free market in security services might organize itself, but his most important point is that no one knows ahead of time how an industry will organize. The security industry has been insulated from market conditions for so long and is so out of touch with the needs of its customers, that I suspect it would be unrecognizable after a transition to its optimal form. There are ten thousand questions that we could muse about similar to the one you posed, but the point is that, if we do our best to adhere to the non-aggression principle, then we can quickly move in the right direction without having to know ahead of time exactly how the final form of such an institution would look. This is where the institution of private property and markets really shine. Markets curb unsustainable growth through the price mechanism. As a needed resource is depleted, its supply drops and, assuming constant or rising demand, its price will rise. Rising prices force people to consume LESS of the resource and save more of it. Private property also incentivizes people to maximize the value of it. People tend to preserve and improve their land and capital. Free enterprise and private property, when honored, are an environmentalists dream. These institutions maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used to satisfy people's desires, and have natural rationing mechanisms built in to keep people from over consuming. If we ever get into some economic theory in this club, we can talk about the concept of the evenly rotating economy, which really drives the point home how only a free society can ever have a hope at sustainability. I can assure you that I am not willfully ignorant. I have a very open mind and if an argument that can stand up to reason and be shown to accurately describe reality is presented to me, then I would gladly change my mind. My views have been forged by a search for the truth that has lasted my entire adult life and continues to this day. I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors. Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward. Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs? We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to. \n",
      "Hey gang, What a week! How do I even begin trying to summarize all of this? A couple of weeks ago, we started seeing the accessibility and speed of Silk Road start to drop, especially around peak hours. Monitoring the number of incoming connections, pageviews and registrations showed record breaking numbers, so the obvious conclusion was that we were getting an influx of new members that was overloading our current infrastructure. We immediately went to work identifying and overcoming the bottlenecks in the system. However, as each was overcome, demand for resources would fill in and run up against the next bottleneck. In the past week we've literally been through every layer of our entire system from hardware, to software, to application making it more efficient and streamlined. We did not rule out the possibility that the increased usage was due to a hacking attempt (known as denial of service, or DoS) and took this time to implement several security measures that had been in the works anyway. Then the site went completely off-line. There are a few things that I don't trust to anyone else, and that's the wallets, and rebooting the system. I was away from my computer when the site went down, and came back a couple of days later to utter chaos on the forums. I've pretty much been in communication since, but basically we did a full redeploy of the entire system including the new security and performance measures which turned out to be quite challenging in the end. We ran into a few stumbling blocks, but were able to get past them. I have to take a moment here to thank my team, both the customer support staff and the technical team. These guys were right there with me the whole time and I don't think I could've gotten through it without them, certainly not as quickly. So, now we are back. What have I learned from all of this? First off, it helped me realize just how much the site means to me and all of you. These forums were like a battleground of opinion, with everyone expressing their concern. By far the worst part of this whole thing was putting everyone through that uncertainty. I knew nothing I could say would make any difference until you had access to your funds and were able to use the site again. So mostly I just focused on getting us back up as quickly as I could without cutting any corners or taking any chances. I also learned a ton about the limitations of the technology we rely on and the direction we need to go to keep Silk Road secure and scalable. Thank you to everyone who encouraged and supported me and the team this week. Your kind words were our fuel. To anyone who doubted us, or suspected us of betrayal, again, I am so sorry to put you through that uncertainty. It is not something I want to repeat ever again and you can rest assured I'll do everything I can to prevent and limit any future down time. I know this whole market is based on the trust you put in me and I don't take that lightly. It's an honor to serve you and though you don't know who I am, and have no recourse if I were to betray you, I hope that as time goes on I will have more opportunities to demonstrate that my intentions are genuine and no amount of money could buy my integrity. Especially you old hats that have been around since the beginning, but this goes for everyone, you all are like family to me. Sure we have some crazy cousins floating around, but they just add character, right? Doesn't matter though, I love you all. Of all the people in the world, you are the ones who are here, in the early stages of this revolution. You are the ones getting this thing off the ground and driving it forward.

      "Dear Silk Road community, A combination of bad luck, bad timing and lack of preparation has led to our forums being down over the last 72 hours or so. I am terribly sorry for any trouble this has caused you. The main market is equipped with a semi-automated backup and redeploy system to minimize this kind of down-time, but I hadn't gotten around to setting the forum up in that way, and this is the consequence. The cause of the downtime was not security related, nor was it caused by a malicious party. Sometimes technology just breaks, and because of the constraints from the nature of our business, it can take time to recover if proper precautions haven't been taken, or don't work as expected. They say absence makes the heart grow fonder, so hopefully we can enjoy each other's company even more now that we've had some time apart. - -DPR   \n",
      "The people who drafted and signed the declaration of independence 237 years ago today were standing up to tyrants just as we are. I'm proud to carry on their legacy. Here are their words, many of which ring true still today: --- When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation. We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness.  That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed,  That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security.  Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world. He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good. He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them. He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only. He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures. He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people. He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within. He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands. He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers. He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries. He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance. He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures. He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power. He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation: For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us: For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States: For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world: For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent: For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury: For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences: For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these Colonies For taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments: For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever. He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us. He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people. He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation. He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands. He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions. In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people. Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends. We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do.  And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor. \n",

      "ok, we're just finishing up some of these changes and starting to push the data out to the pages on the site. Most of it is hidden at the moment, but you can see the layout on the vendor pages has changed. Here's where we are at: The rating algorithm has been changed to the following: A vendor's score, which determines their rank and factors into the weight of buyers, is found by adding up all of their sales with each sale multiplied by a factor that starts at 100% now and tapers off to 0% after 8 months. A buyer's score, which affects how heavily their feedback is weighted when determining a vendor's rating (not rank), is found by multiplying the price of their purchases by the vendor score of the vendor they purchased from, and then adding them all together A rating/review's score, which determines it's weight when averaging with other ratings, is found by multiplying the buyer weight of the buyer leaving the rating, the volume of the purchase, and the same dampening factor used for the vendor's score. We also have a graphic that will appear on vendor pages and when browsing listings that shows the relative weight of the ratings 1 through 5. I've looked at many of these for different vendors and I think it is much more informative than the simple average we have now and will take the pressure off of buyers to leave only a 5 or a 1. This is hidden at the moment. on deck: The average rating (number in parentheses after a vendor's name) is still being calculated the old way. We need to compare the new to the old before updating and make sure there aren't any major discrepancies. Once this is done, we'll switch to the new system and display the rating graphic. next, we'll remove the \"leave feedback\" box from the orders page and leave just the 1 - 5 rating, and add a link to the vendor pages that shows up when you've ordered from them that you can click on and leave a review. then, we'll give the option to sort reviews by most recent or by review weight and display the buyer's stats next to the review (total spent, total transaction, number of vendors bought from, and maybe buyer weight) There is one last thing on deck, but I'm going to leave it as a surprise  \n",
      "Atlantis was good for Silk Road and the community at large and I am sad to see it go. Yes they were a bit cocky and aggressive, but they never crossed the line and did anything unethical, and they served their customers well. They reminded us in the Silk Road administration that to stay #1, we have to be constantly thinking of our users and how to serve them best and can not take for granted your loyalty. There has been more than one occasion where I have wanted to quit as well. Without going into details, the stress of being DPR is sometimes overwhelming. What keeps me going is the understanding that what we are doing here is more important than my insignificant little life. I believe what we are doing will have rippling effects for generations to come and could be part of a monumental shift in how human beings organize and relate to one another. I have gone through the mental exercise of spending a lifetime in prison and of dying for this cause. I have let the fear pass through me and with clarity commit myself fully to the mission and values outlined in the Silk Road charter. If you haven't read it yet, please do. Here is the link: silkroadvb5piz3r.onion/silkroad/charter The bottom line is... Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart. I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here. Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don't have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain. And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site. Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able. \n",

      "\t\t\t\t-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----Hash: SHA1- From it's humble beginnings, the Silk Road market was quickly populated with what has become a vibrant community full of interesting characters.  From our superstar vendors and ever helpful mods to all of the active folks on the forum, the people here are truly awesome.  Silk Road would not be what it is or possibly even exist without everyone who has stepped up along the way to point out security flaws, contribute their ideas, and take this experiment on as their own and stand with us.It didn't take long before word got out.  Our little hidden market got the attention of the media and soon the politicians and law enforcement.  But Silk Road was never meant to be private and exclusive.  It is meant to grow into a force to be reckoned with that can challenge the powers that be and at last give people the option to choose freedom over tyranny.  We fundamentally believe that people can thrive and prosper under these conditions and so far tens of thousands have done so in the Silk Road market.  A revolution has been born.  So ideally, more participants means more prosperity.  What we've found in practice is that if there is an opportunity to cheat, steal or lie for personal short-term gain, someone, somewhere will exploit it.So, we've had two major challenges to face as Silk Road grows and evolves.  One is making our systems tough enough and flexible enough to withstand and win a cyber-war with the most powerful organizations in the world, should they choose to start that war.  This is always and ever a top priority.  The other is making the market a place where people can quickly and easily buy and sell just about anything without worrying about being attacked by gun toting men in uniforms and thrown in a cage or worry about being ripped off by their trading partner.I am proud to say we have been successful in achieving these goals up to this point.  The site remains up and functioning (despite a few screw ups on our part, like not having a full capacity backup server ready to go when a live server went down, and a poorly executed url switch, just to name a few).  And, over 99% of all transactions conducted within the escrow system are completed to the satisfaction of both both buyer and seller, or a mutually agreed upon resolution is found.This success has in no way made us complacent however.  New members are still being lured into trading outside of escrow by scammers and getting ripped off, and “finalizing early”, effectively cutting out the escrow process, is common practice.  Still, I believe we can mitigate these risks and take our market to the next level in security, reliability, performance, and convenience for everyone involved.First we must deal with trading out of escrow.  Up to this point we have charged a flat 6.23% commission on all trades.  This is much too high for transactions in the $300 and over range, making trading out of escrow for large transactions much more attractive than staying within the system.  Now, instead of charging a flat commission, we will charge a higher amount for low priced items and a lower amount for high priced items, similar to how eBay does it.We've worked hard to come up with a commission schedule that should work for everyone and will give scammers no excuse to make people send money outside of escrow.  For some perspective, eBay and amazon charge the following rates:eBay     - $0.50 to list, 11% of the first $50, 6% of $50.01-1000, 2% of $1000.01+amazon - $1.35 + 15% (for almost all items)We also went to the Silk Road independent sellers to see what they thought an appropriate commission schedule would look like.  The average response looked like this:15% of the first $1011% of $10 - $508.14% of $50 - $2505.6% of $250 - $10003.7% of $1000 - $5000We looked at past sales data and our current and future revenue needs and were able to bring these numbers down even further:10% of the first $508.5% of $50 - 1506% of $150 - 3003% of $300 - 5002% of $500 - 10001.5% for everything over $1000With this change, there are no phoney excuses whatsoever for vendors to ask for out of escrow payment.  Any request should be interpreted as a scam attempt and reported to the Silk Road support team via the “contact us” link on the main site.  We are looking at several mechanisms for enforcing the ban on OOE transactions, from self-policing to bounties on offenders.Together, we can beat the scammers and make the Silk Road market a place where you can buy with confidence and peace of mind.  If we stay true to our principles of integrity, virtue, mutual respect and camaraderie that have guided us to this point, I believe our future is bright and this revolutionary experiment will be a success!-----BEGIN PGP SIGNATURE-----Version: GnuPG v2.0.14 (GNU/Linux)iQEbBAEBAgAGBQJPCl0BAAoJEAIiQjtnt/olWDsH9jGBcHVl302TYnOpD/oc2G9wZN1H56v/oRww3het2ESSUokjfoU3JFs5442eNvvNQohHlN3Z2gVBpm4c7BQKVBTBIlfjalIMr1bzMtjVzvwV+CJSF7KHrz91eUDICtpOgNIVQ36CxYA1c9cjHuOVVNbU6N6qVycC4TS2Oy38DUJlYm5UsLcxTqQhlLkiXuUH3uOMp7pwLfPlDmrz4nojWooqFwQ6JBFuMG5/wO0NcKgP4hXWcAmo24oGbaC6/5jUjQ7ze7ILsZf7ykeOi3O3ZhyGn2WyY5+99dc39kviJhIwQfvu8VWaDlYBgvh3PlDENIYD4ThgAzdUoW0Nha4LXA===wI/M-----END PGP SIGNATURE-----CLARIFICATION:  The new policy regarding out of escrow transactions stated in this address does not affect a vendor's ability to ask their customers to finalize their orders and release payment before shipment.  We still strongly recommend that buyers avoid doing this at all costs because we will be unable to protect you in case of fraud.CLARIFICATION:  This new policy also does not affect vendors who use the market as a platform for Bitcoin exchange.  They may continue to operate as usual, but again we strongly recommend that you purchase bitcoins through a non-anonymous vendor because the market is not set up to facilitate bitcoin exchange and your money can be stolen without recourse.FURTHER COMMENTARY: http://dkn255hz262ypmii.onion/index.php?topic=8539.0\n",

      "\t\t\t\tTo be honest, I am quite surprised by how negative the responses have been to the State of the Road Address and how little faith you put in me after I feel like I have done so much to deserve it.  I chose the words I wrote in the Address very carefully.  I reviewed it many times.  Every one of them is true, and my sentiment is valid.  Go through and re-read it along with the clarifications.  Every one of your concerns is addressed if you would only do me the courtesy of believing me.  This change IS about scam prevention.  We ARE working on solutions to the finalizing early and bitcoin exchange scams.  We DID do everything we could to keep the rates low while still addressing the present and future needs of the organization.  Everyone WILL be treated fairly under the new rules just as you have been all along.We also need to be WAY more flexible on this kind of stuff.  It would be amazing if we could try out lots of different commission rates, some way too high, some way too low, to try to find out what works for everyone, but the minute we even mention changing rates everyone becomes an expert on the subject and puts up resistance to change.  There is lots about this organization that just isn't going to be made public and you have to TRUST us that we are doing our absolute best and will always work toward our stated goals, which include giving people the opportunity to choose freedom over tyranny, and to trade in just about any good or service they wish, securely and privately.  Our goals DO NOT include profiting personally at anyone else's expense, or the expense of our stated goals.  If I am greedy, I am greedy for freedom.  I am greedy for power.  Not force over others, but for a world where POWER resides in me and each and every individual, where it belongs.  If we can get to that world, I can die happy.Silk Road is an ENTERPRISE that is just getting started.  It could literally change the world as we know it.  It is bigger than any one of us, and it is going to take the dedication and will of MANY talented people, a lot of luck, and RESOURCES to get from here to there.  Do you want to see this thing go all the way and take the absolute piss out of the power mongers of this world?  Do you want to give it every chance it needs to succeed?  Why aren't you telling me to raise the commission even further then?  I don't hear anyone refusing the commission break on high priced goods.  I don't hear anyone saying “don't do that, you need it, you keep this whole thing going, we're happy to do our part.”As a community, if we are going to survive, we need to adopt a LONG TERM vision.  Getting the most out of this thing before it gets taken down is NOT going to bring us success.  In that world, Silk Road will be a  shooting star that burns out quickly and dies as little more than a dream, swallowed by the nightmare reality of an ever-expanding, all-powerful global oligarchy.  Planning ahead and doing everything we can NOW to prepare for the war to come is the only way we are going to have a shot at this.  We are still mostly ignored by our true enemies, but this incubation WILL NOT last forever.I don't like writing this kind of stuff publicly because it taunts our enemies and might spur them into action, but I risk it because the context for what we are doing is too often lost in the day to day stuff that happens here and it needs to be put in from time to time.  Silk Road NEEDS our support.  It needs everything we have.  The return on what we put into it will be immeasurable if we can get through the months and years ahead and gain a real foothold on the global stage.  HELP ME GET US THERE!!!  Do it for me, do it for yourself, do it for your families and friends, and do it for mankind.P.S.Here's another thing that doesn't get said enough:  I love you.  This is the most fun I've ever had and I feel closer to the people I have met here than the vast majority of people I have to hide all of this from in real life.  Stay light, have fun, and please please please take this on as more than a way to score drugs.  Stand by me as we stand up for ourselves.- Silk Road admin\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThank you for expressing a dissenting viewpoint.  I appreciate a civilized debate, so allow me to respond.  Quote from: bitfool on September 23, 2012, 07:15 amSilk road is nice because it's a fuck-you of sorts to the powers that be......but...It will have no impact whatsoever on the so called war on drugs. It's not going to affect government in any meaningful way. Agorism is a pretty lame strategy.  It may even backfire (from the point of view of agorists) and cause the government to ban tor or bitcoin or both. Of course it can be done, just ask ISPs to do a bit of traffic shaping. Lastly, DPR is doing this for the money.Silk Road has already made an impact on the war on drugs.  The effect of the war is to limit people's access to controlled substances.  Silk Road has expanded people's access.  The great thing about agorism is that it is a victory from a thousand battles.  Every single transaction that takes place outside the nexus of state control is a victory for those individuals taking part in the transaction.  So there are thousands of victories here each week and each one makes a difference, strengthens the agora, and weakens the state.The state may try to ban our tools, but if we never use them for fear of them being banned, then we have already lost, no?  Personally, I don't think they can be effectively banned at this point.  Iran and China, for example, are actively trying and failing.On your last point, we agree, though I'd like to add some clarification.  Money is one motivating factor for me.  If it wasn't I wouldn't impose a commission on trades, or require vendors to use the Silk Road payment processor.  Money motivates me for two reasons.  For one, I have basic human needs that money allows me to meet so that I may devote my time to our cause.  I also enjoy a few first-world pleasures that I feel I have earned, but nothing extravagant.  In fact, compared to most I know, I still live quite frugally.  I buy better food at the grocery store now, and got some new clothes, and am more generous with my friends and loved ones, but I've always been a cheap ass, and still kinda am out of habit.  Besides that, I don't want the attention that buying big toys brings for security reasons.More importantly, money is powerful, and it's going to take power to affect the kinds of changes I want to see.  Money allows us to expand our infrastructure and manpower to accommodate the growing demands of our market and to pursue paths that will compliment and strengthen what's already been created here.All that being said, my primary motivation is not personal wealth, but making a difference.  As corny as it sounds, I just want to look back on my life and know that I did something worthwhile that helped people.  It's fulfilling to me.  If you don't know this joy, you may hear my words as insincere and as a way to manipulate, but I know they are true and resonate with some of you.  There is nothing wrong with living your life to maximize your own pleasure, so long as you aren't hurting anyone in the process, but you will miss out on higher levels of happiness if your focus is always on yourself.  It's paradoxical, but the less you focus on your own happiness and focus on other's, the happier you'll be.  Try it out, you can always go back to being selfish :)\n",

You cannot include your future offspring in the deal as children are not property.Enslaving by force I would have thought is not permitted even by the most extravagant libertarian.       I have continued reading this book ( skipping over his constant crude mischaracterisations of socialism) with interest. I must admit to difficulty in understanding why the author is so idealogically committed to the market as the absolute and only judge of human endevour. To me, the market is a natural force; an extremely complex system of counterbalancing forces that has a tendency to self regulate. But to claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.     An analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.        The market was made for man. It should not be master.        Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\". But we are not talking about teenagers earning spending money here. Child labour regulations were brought in after the industrial revolution, when unbridled capitalism amongst the factories and mills of northern England had driven wages for the \"hands\" below subsistence level. The children of these working families \"wanted\" the \"freedom\" to work, as the alternative was hunger. This to me seems a poor kind of freedom.          You all seem to agree that to force a child to work against his will was wrong. But what if the economic system you have established leaves a child with this kind of choice? Where is the freedom for this child? Work or starve?        Sadly there are many children in the world today faced with this choice. But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.         I feel about the market a similar way that I feel about government: when it ceases to serve our purpose we may freely discard it in favor of a better system.         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations. In many industries there are 3-4 main  players offering roughly the same range of products for the same price, and this tends to lessen the benefits of competition for the consumer. And even when the customer benefits, the suppliers don't.       Large companies suffer many of the same faults as large governments: a tendency to seek nothing but a continuation of their own power. We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force. With all due respect, that's kind of the problem with private police forces! I have difficulty seeing how such a system could work peacefully to resolve disputes.       If I assault my neighbor, who's police force deals with the complaint? His or mine? Or do we both have the same one, being neighbors.       If I am paying a private force, do they take my side automatically. Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.       Some good points ghost, and thanks for not taking offense when the author criticizes your views.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amAn analogy: the human body is a similarly complex network of systems that constantly feedback into each other. By and large it regulates itself and maintains equilibrium.        But when the human body succumbs to disease we don't stand back and declare that 'the body knows best' We intervene when it becomes obvious that the body is failing to address a problem.This gave me pause, because I can see your point.  I think I see where your analogy breaks down though.  There are no competing interests within your self.  You are a unit, an indivisible will or being.  The choices you make to achieve your ends are yours alone.  If your body is ailing and you take medicine, the outcome is your responsibility.  Human civilization on the other hand is made up of many beings, each with their own interests.  What one perceives as good, another may perceive as bad.  Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amThe market was made for man. It should not be master.As described in section 2 of the reading, the market is not yet another policy prescription enforced by government, it is the absence of such force.  It is the absence of one party imposing their view of good and bad on another.  So, the market is not made, it emerges from the multitude of voluntary interactions between individuals.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am Several of you have said in this debate, with reference to child labour regulations, that \" if a child wants to work it should be free to\".

Work or starve?        Sadly there are many children in the world today faced with this choice. But god forbid we should interfere with the sacred motions of the market.I'm not sure how we disagree here.  If the options available to a person are work or starve, why would you take away the work option?  If people are voluntarily choosing to work in a factory under terrible conditions, it means the alternatives available to them are even worse.  That work is an opportunity for them to better themselves.  Child labour regulations only hampered the development and expansion of the industries that were providing these opportunities.Had they been allowed to develop freely, only under the constrains of supply, demand and property rights, they would have had to provide a safe work environment for their employees, if that's what the employees wanted.  Let me give you a quick example.  Nike and Reebok both have shoe factories in the same city.  All of their resources and external conditions are effectively identical.  The only thing they can vary is the quality of the work environment for their employees.  Nike chooses to spend $1 per man-hour maintaining an improved work environment for its employees, while Reebok keeps that dollar as profit.  Reebok will quickly find itself unable to attract the employee base it needs to produce its shoes as Nike takes its employees and market share.  So, Reebok, instead of improving the work conditions, simply passes the extra $1 per hour on to their employees.  Now we are seeing the market at work.  Employees are now faced with the option of a safe work environment, or an extra dollar per hour.  Some will choose safety while others will choose the extra pay.And this is exactly what has happened eventually, where now employers do all they can to attract good employees away from their competitors.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am         The author has many valid criticisms of large government.However, am I alone in noticing a tendency amongst company's to join together in ever larger multinational corporations.

We would be in danger of replacing one leviathan with several smaller beasts.I have also noticed this tendency.  The people who run corporations, heads of state, the person selling you food, you, me and every human being are all fallible and capable of using power to dominate other people.  Liberty is not a pill that makes men angels.  What it does do is limit the extent to which evil can be expressed in the world.  Right now, in any given geographic area, we have a monopoly on many of the most vital social institutions that is maintained through violence.  If voluntary organizations consolidate their power and turn on their customers and start stealing from them, putting them in cages, killing them, spying on them and telling them what they can and can't do, well then we're back to where we started, the present day state.  But, if I am correct, and the pressure for those firms to compete with one another for our favor leads them to serve us, then we can have freedom and prosperity the likes of which the world has never known.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am      Lastly, DPR, you say that you would trust a private security force, whose wages you pay, to defend your interests better than a state run police force.

Or do they arrest me if I do something wrong?        I'm genuinely interested in how it is proposed this will work.Maybe we can read this essay next, but check out Chaos Theory by Robert Murphy.  He speculates how a free market in security services might organize itself, but his most important point is that no one knows ahead of time how an industry will organize.  The security industry has been insulated from market conditions for so long and is so out of touch with the needs of its customers, that I suspect it would be unrecognizable after a transition to its optimal form.  There are ten thousand questions that we could muse about similar to the one you posed, but the point is that, if we do our best to adhere to the non-aggression principle, then we can quickly move in the right direction without having to know ahead of time exactly how the final form of such an institution would look.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 am       Ninthly and finally, none of this free marketry addresses the problem of how all the economies of the world are going to continue growing indefinitely on a planet of finite resources.  This is something that noone really wants to deal with, and the free market is supremely unfitted to face.This is where the institution of private property and markets really shine.  Markets curb unsustainable growth through the price mechanism.  As a needed resource is depleted, its supply drops and, assuming constant or rising demand, its price will rise.  Rising prices force people to consume LESS of the resource and save more of it.  Private property also incentivizes people to maximize the value of it.  People tend to preserve and improve their land and capital.  Free enterprise and private property, when honored, are an environmentalists dream.  These institutions maximize the efficiency with which scarce resources are used to satisfy people's desires, and have natural rationing mechanisms built in to keep people from over consuming.  If we ever get into some economic theory in this club, we can talk about the concept of the evenly rotating economy, which really drives the point home how only a free society can ever have a hope at sustainability.Quote from: Hungry ghost on October 03, 2012, 12:39 amto claim that it always creates the best outcome for society seems willfully ignorant.I can assure you that I am not willfully ignorant.  I have a very open mind and if an argument that can stand up to reason and be shown to accurately describe reality is presented to me, then I would gladly change my mind. My views have been forged by a search for the truth that has lasted my entire adult life and continues to this day.  I started this club because I think the pursuit of truth is one of the most noble human endeavors.  Debating these issues is critical for us to construct a world-view that is grounded in reason and can guide us forward.  Assuming great success for Silk Road, how easily could it become another blood thirsty cartel seeking profit at all costs?  We must maintain our integrity and be true to our principles, the opportunity to make a lasting difference is too great not to.\n",

      "\t\t\t\tThe people who drafted and signed the declaration of independence 237 years ago today were standing up to tyrants just as we are.  I'm proud to carry on their legacy.  Here are their words, many of which ring true still today:---When in the Course of human events it becomes necessary for one people to dissolve the political bands which have connected them with another and to assume among the powers of the earth, the separate and equal station to which the Laws of Nature and of Nature's God entitle them, a decent respect to the opinions of mankind requires that they should declare the causes which impel them to the separation.We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights, that among these are Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness. — That to secure these rights, Governments are instituted among Men, deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed, — That whenever any Form of Government becomes destructive of these ends, it is the Right of the People to alter or to abolish it, and to institute new Government, laying its foundation on such principles and organizing its powers in such form, as to them shall seem most likely to effect their Safety and Happiness. Prudence, indeed, will dictate that Governments long established should not be changed for light and transient causes; and accordingly all experience hath shewn that mankind are more disposed to suffer, while evils are sufferable than to right themselves by abolishing the forms to which they are accustomed. But when a long train of abuses and usurpations, pursuing invariably the same Object evinces a design to reduce them under absolute Despotism, it is their right, it is their duty, to throw off such Government, and to provide new Guards for their future security. — Such has been the patient sufferance of these Colonies; and such is now the necessity which constrains them to alter their former Systems of Government. The history of the present King of Great Britain is a history of repeated injuries and usurpations, all having in direct object the establishment of an absolute Tyranny over these States. To prove this, let Facts be submitted to a candid world.He has refused his Assent to Laws, the most wholesome and necessary for the public good.He has forbidden his Governors to pass Laws of immediate and pressing importance, unless suspended in their operation till his Assent should be obtained; and when so suspended, he has utterly neglected to attend to them.He has refused to pass other Laws for the accommodation of large districts of people, unless those people would relinquish the right of Representation in the Legislature, a right inestimable to them and formidable to tyrants only.He has called together legislative bodies at places unusual, uncomfortable, and distant from the depository of their Public Records, for the sole purpose of fatiguing them into compliance with his measures.He has dissolved Representative Houses repeatedly, for opposing with manly firmness his invasions on the rights of the people.He has refused for a long time, after such dissolutions, to cause others to be elected, whereby the Legislative Powers, incapable of Annihilation, have returned to the People at large for their exercise; the State remaining in the mean time exposed to all the dangers of invasion from without, and convulsions within.He has endeavoured to prevent the population of these States; for that purpose obstructing the Laws for Naturalization of Foreigners; refusing to pass others to encourage their migrations hither, and raising the conditions of new Appropriations of Lands.He has obstructed the Administration of Justice by refusing his Assent to Laws for establishing Judiciary Powers.He has made Judges dependent on his Will alone for the tenure of their offices, and the amount and payment of their salaries.He has erected a multitude of New Offices, and sent hither swarms of Officers to harass our people and eat out their substance.He has kept among us, in times of peace, Standing Armies without the Consent of our legislatures.He has affected to render the Military independent of and superior to the Civil Power.He has combined with others to subject us to a jurisdiction foreign to our constitution, and unacknowledged by our laws; giving his Assent to their Acts of pretended Legislation:For quartering large bodies of armed troops among us:For protecting them, by a mock Trial from punishment for any Murders which they should commit on the Inhabitants of these States:For cutting off our Trade with all parts of the world:For imposing Taxes on us without our Consent:For depriving us in many cases, of the benefit of Trial by Jury:For transporting us beyond Seas to be tried for pretended offences:For abolishing the free System of English Laws in a neighbouring Province, establishing therein an Arbitrary government, and enlarging its Boundaries so as to render it at once an example and fit instrument for introducing the same absolute rule into these ColoniesFor taking away our Charters, abolishing our most valuable Laws and altering fundamentally the Forms of our Governments:For suspending our own Legislatures, and declaring themselves invested with power to legislate for us in all cases whatsoever.He has abdicated Government here, by declaring us out of his Protection and waging War against us.He has plundered our seas, ravaged our coasts, burnt our towns, and destroyed the lives of our people.He is at this time transporting large Armies of foreign Mercenaries to compleat the works of death, desolation, and tyranny, already begun with circumstances of Cruelty & Perfidy scarcely paralleled in the most barbarous ages, and totally unworthy the Head of a civilized nation.He has constrained our fellow Citizens taken Captive on the high Seas to bear Arms against their Country, to become the executioners of their friends and Brethren, or to fall themselves by their Hands.He has excited domestic insurrections amongst us, and has endeavoured to bring on the inhabitants of our frontiers, the merciless Indian Savages whose known rule of warfare, is an undistinguished destruction of all ages, sexes and conditions.In every stage of these Oppressions We have Petitioned for Redress in the most humble terms: Our repeated Petitions have been answered only by repeated injury. A Prince, whose character is thus marked by every act which may define a Tyrant, is unfit to be the ruler of a free people.Nor have We been wanting in attentions to our British brethren. We have warned them from time to time of attempts by their legislature to extend an unwarrantable jurisdiction over us. We have reminded them of the circumstances of our emigration and settlement here. We have appealed to their native justice and magnanimity, and we have conjured them by the ties of our common kindred to disavow these usurpations, which would inevitably interrupt our connections and correspondence. They too have been deaf to the voice of justice and of consanguinity. We must, therefore, acquiesce in the necessity, which denounces our Separation, and hold them, as we hold the rest of mankind, Enemies in War, in Peace Friends.We, therefore, the Representatives of the united States of America, in General Congress, Assembled, appealing to the Supreme Judge of the world for the rectitude of our intentions, do, in the Name, and by Authority of the good People of these Colonies, solemnly publish and declare, That these united Colonies are, and of Right ought to be Free and Independent States, that they are Absolved from all Allegiance to the British Crown, and that all political connection between them and the State of Great Britain, is and ought to be totally dissolved; and that as Free and Independent States, they have full Power to levy War, conclude Peace, contract Alliances, establish Commerce, and to do all other Acts and Things which Independent States may of right do. — And for the support of this Declaration, with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Providence, we mutually pledge to each other our Lives, our Fortunes, and our sacred Honor.\n",

Silk Road is here to stay so long as there is breath in my lungs, a spark in my mind, and fire in my heart.  I know many of you in this community feel the same way and is an honor to stand beside you here.Lastly, to anyone considering opening another market, you WILL face unexpected challenges one way or another, and if you don't have the conviction to overcome them then your efforts will likely be in vain.  And please open up a dialogue with me if you do open another site.  Even competitors can talk from time to time on friendly terms :)Atlantis admins, if you are reading this, I hope you stick around and contribute as you are able.\n",
